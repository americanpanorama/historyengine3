He proposed the construction of a huge public park that would \"be enjoyed by thousands of all classes, without distinction.\"  The ideals of Romanticism and the Republican view of the importance of nature were at a peak among educated Americans at this time and this commentator proposed a way to manifest these ideals.  New York City, being the largest city as well as the informational center, certainly had many who supported the idea that nature should be valued and used respectfully to enrich one's mind and refresh one's spirit.  From these beliefs arose the idea for the creation of a huge park to be enjoyed by all the citizens of New York City.  This journalist, in <u>The Horticulturist, and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste</u>, was one of the first to publish his opinions on the issue and explain the beginnings of such a park.  He criticized New York for not having enough open public spaces, and emphasized the Republican idea that nature is closely linked with virtue and comparing New York to cities in Europe, most of which had public parks.  The mayor of New York at the time, Ambrose Kingsland, had recently proposed 160 acres for a park.  This proposal was the first of its kind in America for park of such large scale, but the writer condemned this as being too small.  He suggested a 500 acre plot of land between the Harlem River and 39th, land that is in fact today part of Central Park.   Although this author's passionate essay on the importance of establishing a large park brought no immediate action, it marked the beginning of a huge public interest in such an endeavor.  Two years later, in 1853, there were still only 143 acres out of New York's 14,000 dedicated to public spaces, including cemeteries.  Many later authors continued the journalist's argument; one enumerated the reasons why such a park was a necessity for the city, being a haven for health, recreation, and driving and riding.  The park's approval and design finally took form in the late 1850's.  The proposal for Central Park had a huge impact on New York City as well as the patterns of urban development across the country."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":8924,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4093,"title":"Women&#39;s Benevolent Societies\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-09-14","end_date":"1831-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 14, 1831, members of the Female Assistance Society of New York met to discuss preparations for their charitable work for the upcoming winter.  Eighteen years previously, the organization had been founded by wives of high status New York men who wished to do more than simply be an ordinary housewife.  The main focus of this non profit organization was to provide as much assistance as possible to the poor and homeless people living on the streets of New York City.  It was to be made clear to the rest of society that these women were not focusing on their own charity work out of selfishness; their simple goal was to aid the poor, sick, widowed, and homeless, and provide these people with a fraction of the sense of security they themselves felt.  At this particular meeting, the officers discussed how they should be preparing for the approaching winter in regards to helping the homeless.  The previous winter had been terrible, and the members of the organization wanted to ensure that they would have the capabilities to provide assistance to more people than they had in earlier years.","The Female Assistance Society of New York was not the first formal organization of women.  Primarily in New York and Boston, females of prominent Protestant households had been working in organized groups to assist the less fortunate for decades.  During their early years, the procedural aspects of these societies were managed solely by women, but in order to reach their goals, male counterparts were called in for financial management purposes.  Some groups were more successful than others, and this depended largely on the demographic of the group they were attempting to assist.  The New York Society for the Relief of Poor Widows wit Small Children campaigned successfully for funds, while the Boston Female Moral Reform Society faced more trouble finding financial support, as the most prominent members of society were reluctant to donate to a charity for \"unrespectable\" women.  ","By 1850, the most prevalent female organization was the Ladies Benevolent Society, which had many of the same goals as the Female Assistance Society.  Founded by the wives of prominent Protestant men of the time, this society provided aid and a foundation of Christian beliefs to those less fortunate, particularly widows and orphans.  The creation of such societies that were managed entirely by women were the early foundations of the women's rights movement that dominated a large part in the history of the early twentieth century.  Although these women were not seeking independence from their husbands or any rights of their own, the way in which they organized entire societies on their own accord with little or no help from the men in their lives shows how women were able to take initiative to accomplish what they wanted on their own.

The caricature of \"Jim Crow\" was meant to represent a low class runaway slave who used cunning to reap the benefits of middleclass lifestyle without any of the responsibility.

By the end of 1841 Washingtonians claimed that over 200,000 had signed their pledge, and by 1842 they had recruited over one million people. The Washingtonian Temperance Society took a new approach to curing intemperance.

In the winter of 1862, when Timrod wrote \"Carolina\", the war had only begun and young men still believed in victory for the South.

A small number disguised themselves as men and snuck onto the battlefield, others became nurses, and still more stayed at home to sew uniforms and pack provisions.  From the start of the war in 1861, magazines such as <em>Harper's Weekly</em> encouraged women to sacrifice their resources, time, and families for their nation.  After kissing their husbands and sons farewell, women set up domestic labor groups to fulfill their patriotic duties and show courage even while far removed from the battlefield.  This courage demanded that women suffer emotional wounds sometimes considered more harmful than the physical wounds suffered by the men they loved.","            As the war progressed, resources in the South grew slim and women became impatient.  As more sons and husbands died, women began to question their role in society without a man - should they devote themselves wholeheartedly to the war or fight for their own freedom?  The elite women's dresses grew dingy while the lower classes struggled to find bread and coffee for each night's meal.  Over time sewing groups turned into political discussions, and the boldest women began writing letters to government officials and army officers beseeching them to bring the men home.  Others wrote poems and prayers published in magazines, trying to impress the magnitude of their suffering.  Letters to their husbands begged them to come home to protect their families.  Southern women feared God was no longer on their side.  As they debated whether it might be easier on the battlefield than at home, they tried to find the balance between gentleness and valor required of them.

Yet there are some people who differ, like Benjamin B. Thatcher.  ","In his <em>Indian Biography</em>, Thatcher argued that the Native American was not resigned to such a savage state, but that there existed among them great \"patriots, orators, warriors, and statesmen\" who merely \"ruled over barbarian communities.\"  Indeed, Thatcher ventured to say that we and our fathers owed much to the Native Americans.  Thatcher details the lives and deeds of several notable Native American leaders, such as Philip.  Thatcher gives an account of Philip during Philip's War, and how he displayed a \"courage as noble as his intellect.\"  According to this account, Philip did not mistreat his captives, he saved the life of a man named James Brown, and he gave kindness and protection to the Leonard Family of Raynham.  In battle, Philip was noble and strong, displaying the likeness of a lion.  This is in great contrast to the colonists' treatment of Philip.  They paraded his head around the colony and sold his nine year old son into slavery.  ","Fairchild's <em>The Noble Savages</em> argues that there was a connection between the idea of the \"noble savage\" and romantic naturalism, or a return to nature.  Romantic naturalism was of growing interest during the 19th century.  She says, \"To me, a Noble Savage is any free and wild being who draws directly from nature virtues which raise doubts as to the value of civilization.\"  This view of the Indians runs in steep contrast to the racist and stereotypically hostile view of many Americans.  Barnett's <em>The Ignoble Savage </em>tells us the colonists often regarded the Indians as \" 'aesthetical, proud, wild, barbarous, bruitish (in one word) diabolicall creatures.'\"","The conclusion we can gather from Thatcher, Fairchild, and Barnett is that during the 19th century there was a sort of growing sense of romantic naturalism associated with the Indian, and that the view of the Indian was indeed dynamic, although there was still a considerable force of prejudice and racism to be reckoned with.

Henry W. Grady was born in Georgia and was throughout his career a spokesman, a proponent, and an ambassador for the South to the rest of the world. Growing up in the disenfranchised and embittered South, Grady had a vision of a reintegrated South that would take its place of glory and prominence in the newly restored nation. Harold Davis describes how Grady, who was barely in his thirties when his career took off, became a \"household [name] in the homes of most educated Americans.\" His most famous and influential speech came in 1886 when he addressed the New England Society in New York. In that renowned speech he referred to what famously became known as the \"New South.\" It was a speech and a phrase that would forever change the perceptions and views of the South.","One of the chief editors of the Atlanta Constitution and a key politician in the city of Atlanta, Grady was a very influential man.

According to the New York Times in July of 1888, there was \"a vast army of men and women and a few children in New York engaged in making clothes.\" Historically, the clothes industry had undergone many tariff protections. For instance, all the parts of a woman's dress or a man's suit were \"protected\" by astronomical tariffs: on such items as \"raw wool, the cotton yarn, the print cloth, the thread, the buttons, linings, trimmings and woolen cloth.\" The article, \"Clothes Makers and the Tariff,\" argued for the Mill Bill, a bill that would allow for laborers to enjoy higher wages and, consequently, a better and cheaper standard of living. This piece of legislation hoped to encourage these positive alterations by making wool \"free,\" like cotton, which already enjoyed freedom from large duties. ","    In 1888, cotton's rate of duty was approximately 40 percent, compared to the 69 percent experienced by the wool industry. The New York Times discovered that this increase in duty did not benefit the wage earners. Instead, it merely added to the profits of the companies. Meanwhile, there were large numbers of people smuggling foreign goods into the country, which only further increased the problems instilled by the current duty. The Mill Bill hoped to take positive actions to \"excel\" in the worldwide clothing manufacturing market, a foreign idea in the \"cloth making business\" in the late 19th century. Instead, countries such as England dominated in these areas because of the United States' high duties. ","    The factories, which should have been filled with the \"music of contented labor,\" were instead filled with the miserable sounds of the \"poverty-stricken.\" The introduction of the Mill Bill would allow factories to become happier places, with lower costs to the manufacturer and lower costs of materials. With the reduction of duties as proposed by this bill, the United States and New York City would be able to compete with foreign competitors, have happier employees, and extend the clothing market. ","    The sentiments expressed through both this article and the Mill Bill were supported by the women and the Democrat Party's campaign throughout 1888 and 1892. Women worked in these clothing factories in an 11:1 ratio of females to males, and shopping and consumerism had continually become a female duty. The Democratic Party and the tariff reform movement involved both working-class women and middle-class women, whose voices strove to be heard through the ballots of their husbands. The Democratic Party employed moral arguments for economic reforms as Democratic women argued that these tariffs were stealing incomes from hard-working families, and they blamed the Republicans for this insanity. Through reforms such as the tariff reform, women gained their political voice as they marched their husbands to the ballot boxes. As reported by the Woman's Tribune, \"political parties [began] to take note of what will be women's wish.\" In the 1890 election, women's influence and the tariff issue seemed to dominate the Democrat's \"sweeping victories,\" as women gained political power through the ballots of their men and under the pretext of tariff reform and legislation, such as the Mill Bill.

Grimes has not been out of the house since that incident.","Grimes wrote a poem and sent it to Blue about \"the abolishun ov nigger slavery.\" The poem was included in the letter and was published in <em>Harper's Weekly</em> along with the letter. In the poem she deals sarcastically with Blue's sentiments that Lincoln should not emancipate the slaves because of their economic worth to the South. Blue has not answered the poem.","Reaction to the Proclamation was mixed among northern intellectuals as well as among the common people. Many framed the issue in terms of Federal versus States rights while others thought the only way for this plan to be successful was to deport the slaves after their emancipation. It is interesting that someone as simple as Sarah Blue would have comprehended the magnitude of the economic consequences and importance of slavery for the South."],"display_date":"November 8, 1862","search_date":"1862-11-08","locations":[{"id":8926,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4661,"title":"A Defeat So Sweet","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-11-03","end_date":"1876-11-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 3, 1876 Rutherford B.

This was an important event because the international slave trade had been considered piracy but had not been prosecuted due to the existence of slavery in the United States. Now, however, the Lincoln administration changed all that with the first execution by hanging of one of the most notorious and successful of all of the slave traders.","Gordon, a native of Maine, had been engaged in the slave trade for many years. On August 8, 1860 off the West Coast of Africa his ship stopped and was boarded by Lieutenant Henry D. Todd, U.S.N. of the United States steamer <em>Mohican</em>. When Lieutenant Todd boarded the ship which was flying the American flag he was horrified by both the sight and smell of what he saw.  On board, he found eight hundred and ninety-seven men, women and children. They ranged in age from six months to forty years; half were children and the other half, one quarter men and one quarter women. They were so crowded together he could not move without stepping on someone. The smell was so foul as to be sickening. Disease ran rampant. Twenty-nine had died and been thrown overboard.","The sailors claimed that they had been told this was a legitimate voyage or they would have never signed on. They also said that it was obvious that Gordon was the Captain. Gordon eventually admitted to them that the <em>Erie</em> was a slave ship and they were told they would receive one dollar for each slave who arrived safely at their destination.","Gordon was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. All attempts to have him pardoned were unsuccessful and he was scheduled to be hanged. The night before, he somehow managed to come into the possession of a poison, probably strychnine, and attempted to commit suicide rather than face the hangman's noose. Unfortunately for him, his attempt was thwarted by the efforts of physicians who pumped his stomach and saved his life. ","Gordon's last request was that they cut a lock of his hair and send it to his wife along with a ring he removed from his finger. Gordon was given rather large amounts of whiskey to keep him alive for the execution and so he was not sober when he went to his fate. ","The execution of Gordon was so important a signal of the impending end of the slave trade that the execution was held in an unlikely place – City Prison, New York City – better known as \"The Tombs\". Gordon was the only slave trader ever executed in the United States.

At the time, no one knew exactly where the sparks had ignited and the fire begun, but by Thursday afternoon, the flames had engulfed approximately seventeen square blocks on and surrounding Wall Street. An article in the magazine The Albion indicated that by Thursday evening between 700 and 1000 buildings in the financial district, many only five or six years old, had been damaged.  Firefighters desperately attempted to extinguish the flames, but the unusually cold weather was accompanied by high winds.  As a result, flames quickly spread and water hoses froze, making the job near impossible.  Finally, fire companies chose to collect gunpowder from Navy Yards nearby and demolish buildings in the path of the fire to prevent it spreading to other parts of the city.","The final estimate suggested New Yorkers lost the equivalent of fifteen million dollars in private property during the fifteen hour fire. Insurance companies holding policies on many of the city's downtown buildings were ruined, some able to pay only twenty-five to fifty cents on the dollar in benefits.  Remarkably, shipping facilities along the river's banks remained safe from major damage.  Yet New York lay in ruins, and local officials sent in militias to protect against looting and damage over the coming weekend.  \"The arm of man was powerless…\" a journalist wrote, \"and many of our fellow citizens who retired to pillows in affluence, were bankrupts upon awaking.\"","New York had grown quickly in the early nineteenth century, and as the city expanded, fire companies, which had served as social clubs to many property owners in the past, now became associations for the poorer and much larger working classes of the American city.  Not only did these companies grow rapidly (some individual companies exceeding memberships of 300), but they became rallying points of community loyalty, oftentimes based on ethnicity. The result was fierce rivalry between the companies themselves.  In Philadelphia, for example, Irish Catholic and Irish Protestant companies raced horse-drawn hose carriages through the streets en route to a fire while in the process sabotaging one another's equipment, disabling truck wheels and cutting tow lines.  Competition between rival companies would often become so fierce that riots began.  In New York, as in Philadelphia, this trend only worsened as time went on, as some companies carried overlapping memberships with community gangs that could lead to further violence.  Naturally, these tensions directly related to the effectiveness of companies in extinguishing fires."],"display_date":"December 16, 1835 - December 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-16","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4470,"title":"Class Tensions Arise in the Markets of Hester Street","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1898-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"The true heart of the Lower East Side beat in the street,\" and Hester Street was no exception. It served as the hub of life in the Lower East Side – teeming with women shopping, children playing and peddlers manning their pushcarts full of food. While the tenements towered high above blocking out the sky, the streets were overrun with peddlers and their pushcarts and their female clientele milling about from cart to cart, bartering and looking for the best deal. Between 1880 and 1890 over 60,000 Jews inhabited the Lower East Side, and for them, the streets served as their community center, marketplace, and playground. Everything that Jewish immigrant families needed could be found in the markets and carts on Hester Street crowding the streets: groceries, books, and even house wares. Interaction, especially for Jewish women, in the markets of Hester Street was vital to their survival in the new American culture","Immigrant women in New York's lower East Side lived a decidedly different life than the progressive reforming women. The staunch lines drawn public and private space did not apply to everyday immigrant realities. The cult of domesticity promoted the virtues of women managing their private sphere docile passivity, By contrast, Jewish immigrant women of the Lower East Side readily and actively engaged in public life and the market economy. Some even operated their own pushcarts and stalls. The streets of the Lower East Side were more than mere thoroughfares and marketplaces a place for women to congregate, forge social networks, and exert their influence.","The active place that Jewish immigrant women held in public market life was at odds with the established American bourgeois ideals concerning women's roles and propriety. It was not uncommon for Jewish women to work in the markets, peddle goods, while also managing the fiscal affairs for the family. They were accustomed to these breadwinning roles from the old country. But though Hester Street closely resembled European street markets, the moral reformers did not approve. Instead, they saw the poverty of the Lower East Side as a sign of a moral failure on the part of the Jewish mothers. The reformers sought a regeneration of the immigrant population through the adoption of the reformer's own Protestant work ethic. Female social workers at the time, like those of Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago, did not see Jewish women's role in the market place as a way for these women to exercise their authority and autonomy. Rather they saw it as an example of idleness and chaos. They disapproved of women's participation in street life. The tension between the dueling views of a woman's place –connecting with the other immigrant women in the street versus acting solely as the queen of the household came to a head not in the first generation immigrant, but rather their daughters.

As American Jewish historian Hasia Diner notes, \"at the right moment in time, under the right conditions, ordinary places become transformed into spaces throbbing with meaning.\"  Such was the case with New York's iconic Lower East Side.  The photo shows Hester Street, a main avenue through the Lower East Side, clearly depicting the neighborhood's massive population.  The scene is inundated with adults selling goods and children playing in the street, framed by dozens of towering tenement houses crowded closely together.  Due to the living conditions within the tenements, most activities like business and recreation took place in the street.","As author Deborah Hopkinson details, in the mid 1800s, tenement buildings were hurriedly and inexpensively built in the Lower East Side to quickly accommodate hoards of new immigrants.  Hearing stories about new opportunities available in a predominantly Jewish atmosphere, multitudes of European Jews flocked to New York, America's hub of immigration, in search of a new life.  By the late 1800s, the Lower East Side quickly earned a reputation as America's ultimate Jewish neighborhood, filled with Jewish immigrants.  By 1910, more Jews lived in New York City than any other city in history.  But, with such a rapid influx of people, the Lower East Side neighborhood was forced to deal with a serious urban housing problem: overcrowding.","Tenement buildings served as the main source of housing, providing very modest living spaces for newly arrived immigrants.  But, over time, most Lower East Side tenements fell into disrepair as many landlords lacked interest in maintenance or improvements.  Therefore, by the 1880s, the already overcrowded tenements became unsafe and unhealthy havens of filth, often lacking necessary amenities.  The worsening living conditions of the Lower East Side drove some individuals to action, including Jewish immigrant and journalist Jacob Riis.  Noting that \"nowhere in the world are so many people crowded together on a square mile as [the Lower  East Side],\" Riis drew attention to the urban overcrowding problem through photographs.","With the invention of flash photography in the 1880s, Riis and other individuals were able to clearly depict Lower East Side housing problems by capturing indoor images of the actual dark, decrepit, overpopulated living spaces inside the tenements.  Riis' revealing photos later appeared in his famous 1890 book, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, influencing later New York City housing reforms like the Tenement House Law of 1901 and the creation of the Tenement House Commission.  These decisions enforced new safety and health standards for New York's overcrowded tenement buildings and set a precedent for urban renewal in the United States."],"display_date":"1880 - 1901","search_date":"1890-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4472,"title":"Murder of Geographic Proportions","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-06-25","end_date":"1897-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["","What is more interesting than a story that involves a jealous love triangle that results in the murder of a man and the arrest of another who has been betrayed by a friend and lover? It is the realization that this is not a plot line for a fictional soap opera, but a real account that occurred in the Lower East Side of New York City in 1897. Martin Thorn and William Guidensuppe were both competing for the love of Mrs. Nack. When the barber, Thorn, discovered the encounters of Nack and Guidensuppe he was overcome with jealousy and killed Guidensuppe with Nack's help. The role that gender plays into this murder is not unusual when the urban circumstance is considered because the strict limitations placed on individuals by their close proximity to others.  When people are placed closer together there is more violence between males because they are hoping to establish a sense of dominance not only in the community, but also to protect their resources.  In this situation it could be argued that Thorn saw Guidensuppe as a threat to his relationships and his territory. Furthermore, it is the role that geography played out in development and resolution of this crime that is truly unique.","While the actual murder occurred in the Woodside community in Long Island, the body was purposely cut into pieces and hidden around New York so that the authorities would not be able to identify the victim, Guidensuppe. Two children from the Lower East Side found one part of the body when they were playing along the East River. They discovered only the torso and arms, while they discovered that the rest of the body was missing. The lower half of Guidenssupe's trunk was found in the northern part of the city by the Washington Bridge, and eventually the legs were found in a Navy-Yard in Brooklyn. The deliberate placement of the body pieces shows that Thorn and Nack's perceptions of communities within the city and the constraint that it places on the citizens was too strong to extend beyond the neighborhoods they lived in. The Chicago School of sociologists would argue that this had a huge impact on their decision to carry out the murder in such a unique way because they theorize that environmental characteristics like density, housing types, land use, social heterogeneity define the social constraints of an individual. If we hold this theory to be true it is understandable why Thorn and Nack would have thought this was the perfect crime because the threesome lived in a close proximity despite the size of the city: Guidensuppe worked for a Turkish bath on West Forty-Second Street and Mrs. Nack lived on near by on Ninth Avenue.","Location, however, was not a limiting factor and this was due mostly to the influence of the media.  As the men who found the remains at the Washington Bridge location recognized the unique packaging as a result of reading about the Lower East Side reports of a mutilated body being found in similar packaging. This is explained by the sociodemographic theory in which social interactions with neighbors are based in differential access to resources that allow people to deal with their social environment, and the paper being a constant resource in New York City these various enclaves were drawn together rather than being kept separate. This murder also showed the role of national media and its growth in this period as this article about the Guidensuppe murder was found in the Chicago Tribune. The editor and founder of the Chicago Tribune, Joseph Medill, was known for publishing sensational stories in hopes of gaining readers. This story certainly fits the bill with its articulate and vivid language like, \"body shockingly mutilated.\" While the motives of Medill were most likely profit driven to publish this piece it gives New York City a sense of legitimacy as their news was being published in other cities, and also gives rise to the spread of information around the country.  "," "," "],"display_date":"June 25, 1897 - November 8, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-01","locations":[{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":70,"tag":"Geography"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4475,"title":"A Liberty Party Leader Assists A Fellow Abolitionist\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-07-27","end_date":"1852-07-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Gerrit Smith was a prominent abolitionist and leader of the early Liberty Party during the 1840s and 1850s.

In a letter to a friend, Smith described how he had posted bail on different occasions for a man named Chaplin, who was being punished for enticing slaves away from their southern masters.  Gerrit Smith felt that the money he spent on bailing Chaplin out of jail, though costly, was necessary because it was for a good and just purpose.  He wrote, \"I am robbed of these 12,000.

At the same time, law enforcement had every right, according to the Fugitive Slave Act, to put someone in jail for aiding in the escape of slaves.

Riis in his groundbreaking 1890 work, <em>How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York,</em> describe a desolate corner of the urban decay that characterized New York's Lower East Side in the late 1800s. Riis, a Danish immigrant who came to New York in 1870, used cutting edge flash photography to illustrate the depraved conditions of the city and quickly gained notoriety as one of the leading \"muckrakers;\" a name referring to group of reformers who used journalism to lead the way in exposing social problems and the call for reform.","One of the chapters in the book focuses on the conditions of Mulberry Bend just north of the Five Points, which Riis illustrates with a photograph showing the chaotic look of the street on a typical day. Riis describes in detail how street crime and gangs prevailed in \"the Bend\" over the local law enforcement and how the death rate was extremely high within the area, which was fifty percent higher than the rest of the city. Especially tragic was the death rate for children under five, which was significantly higher than all other areas. Central to the problem facing Riis at this time was a way to solve the issues of urban decay and the slums in a way which would go beyond the limitations of philanthropy but without advocating a socialist doctrine, which would be condemned by those in power. Beginning in 1888 and continuing into the 1890s Riis began giving lectures that incorporated photographs of the conditions of \"the Bend\" to philanthropic groups and the general public, which supplemented his journalistic newspaper writing to help spread awareness about the slum problem.","In 1888 the Tenement House Committee of New York had drawn up plans for Mulberry Park in the block between Bayard, Park, Baxter, and Mulberry streets, which made up the area known as \"the Bend.\" It would take six more years until the property was bought for the park. The major reason for the slow action by the committee stems from the hesitancy of city officials to mettle in the affairs of the landlords of tenements in the most need of change. It was the release of Riis's book and the public outcry that accompanied it that finally helped to push the city toward purchasing the land and building the park. On December 21, 1893 Riis offered a solution to the unemployment of the city in the New York <em>Evening Sun </em>in which he called for the use of public funds to hire workers to demolish the depraved buildings that made up \"the Bend.\" Even after the land was purchased and the buildings were demolished in 1895 the area remained barren until 1897 when the park opened. It was only due to increased pressure from Riis and other reformers that the park within the urban slum could be finally realized. Possibly the greatest irony involved in the creation of the park came at its dedication on June 15, 1897; a ceremony in which Riis was not invited to attend."],"display_date":"1888 - 1897","search_date":"1892-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4478,"title":"Boys and Baseball","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-02-09","end_date":"1883-02-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Boys do not like sitting around and talking. They would much rather be running, jumping, throwing, and screaming.","So it comes as a complete surprise to see that on February 9, 1883, a group of adolescent boys, aged anywhere from ten to sixteen, gathered together as delegates of eleven of New York's grammar schools to form a baseball club. The boys came from the city's schools, known by numbers and not by designated names, to elect officers, discuss membership, and resolve important problems like whether or not teachers should be umpires (According to the boys, teachers would make lousy umpires because they do not understand the game and may show favoritism). Acting very much like adults and unlike immature kids, the schoolboys committed to meeting the next week to continue discussion about the organization.","There are several interesting points in this simple meeting. Baseball, quickly becoming America's pastime, was still in its infancy. Major cities did have forms of professional teams, but often players had regular jobs, making baseball little more than a serious hobby. The idea of a highly organized league for professionals was still years away, and in most cases, those wanting to play the game would have to join a baseball club structured very similar to the one the schoolboys designed. Moreover, sport as a spectacle had not yet become popular, and games did not draw the crowds or the money they do today.","But this story also brings out ideas about the city during the late 19th century. Today, no respectable parent would allow adolescents the free reign of the city, an idea imperative for the boys to form the group. Instead of isolation kids might find in cities today, kids of the late 19th century had options for all kinds of action.","This article also speaks about 19th century home life. Baseball was still somewhat of a renegade sport, played at this time in spare lots which were a far cry from the manicured palaces found in city parks today. And while parents disapproved of the game—mainly because it seemed to replace work with pleasure—boys needed the baseball diamond as a refuge from home.

The migration introduced new eager American citizens to the north during a time when new faces were foreign faces. For African Americans, the lure of freedom from Jim Crow laws, a higher and fairer wage for labor, and a fresh start to life was reasons enough to move to \"the promised land\". New York among other big cities was the destinations of choice for African Americans. The newly emancipated African Americans brought to the north a lifestyle they adapted to in the south. This lifestyle became integrated into communities African Americans inhabited. My primary source is a postcard from the early 1900's of Forest Avenue in New York City depicting a Congregationalist church at a corner street in a supposedly black neighborhood. The postcard not only depicts many traits of the turning century, but also provides small but significant insight into how the church acted as an aid and an outlet for those making not only a transition into a new century but also a social and cultural transition at the same time.","            The settlement in the north proved the church served as an alleviation and refuge from the acclimation to a strange new home and community. The church's role in the north was often similar to the way it was in the south during slavery. As conditions in New York became overcrowded, places of worship were hard to find among the busy streets. However once churches were developed, often being erected from older buildings, the church served as the center of a community. One of my supporting sources is also a primary source that is a newspaper article describing the events of the dedication of a new location for the <em>Forest Avenue Church</em>. Before it took the name <em>First Congregational Church of Morrisania</em> it was known as <em>Forest Avenue Congregational Church </em>and was established in 1851. The dedication described by <em>The New York Times</em> was not a long article, but gave only the basic details of the ceremony. The actual ceremony was long and included many keynote area speakers indicating this was a significant event for the community. The African American population boom brought new ideologies in denomination and Christian perspectives and accounted for more and more African American churches and communities springing up. Once many African Americans migrated north religion and worship continued to be a very key practice. However, the spirit and style of African American worship changed significantly once the migration occurred. More specifically was the Negro spiritual and how song and dance was incorporated in church. The worship services were not as stringent as they were in the South and for good reason because they now had reason to celebrate their deliverance. As this \"second emancipation\" occurred northern cities and people were forced to handle the product of victory in the Civil War. ","            Like many foreign immigrants, African American immigrants had to live in close quarters and earn small wages. They escaped much of the discrimination experienced in the south, yet hardships were not far off. Religion was a backbone of African American life in the south, and it was the same in the north. The church was able to unveil the well-beaten Underground Railroad allowing many more African Americans to travel northward. This was a time of change in American history that ushered in new developments for regional development and identity. Along with providing a link between the north and the south, the African American migration and subsequent expansion of the church provided a visibly direct by-product of the events of slavery and Civil War.

Rice, water casks, and cooking utensils were shipped on board of the vessel.  The only problem was that having rice, cooking utensils, and water casks together on board the vessel could be considered \"conclusive evidence of an intention on the part of the master or owner to employ the vessel in transporting Negroes from Africa to be sold as slaves.\"  Because of this, they had to sneak the water casks on board somewhere quiet, usually at the latest time possible before departure.  \"Nineteen vessels out of every twenty fitted out in the United States for this illegal traffic on the coast of Africa, manage to evade the law,\" one newspaper editor observed.  After having left port safely, the vessel had nothing to fear because British ships believed the United States government would not allow slave ships to sail under an American flag.  Once the vessel had reached Africa, it would \"run into one of the numerous river arms that characterized the African coast.\"  These river arms offered great places to load the slaves without attracting attention, and slavers could choose when they felt the best time of departure would be.  On the way back, the vessels went to Cuba, where the slaves were unloaded and \"distributed among the sugar plantations.\"  Slavers sometimes burned their vessels to destroy evidence and thus avoid capture.","A dramatic increase of illicit traffic and actual importations of slaves took place in the decade 1850-1860.  The fitting out of slavers became a prosperous business in the United States, one centered in New York City.  Vessels leaving New York were in close alliance with legitimate trade.  Downtown merchants of wealth and respectability engaged in buying and selling African slaves throughout the 1850s with little interference from the government.  \"During eighteen months of the years 1859-1860 eighty-five slavers were reported to have been fitted out in New York harbor, and these alone transported from 30,000 to 60,000 slaves annually,\" wrote historian W.E.B. Dubois.  \"The United States deputy marshal of that district declared in 1856 that the business of fitting out slavers was never prosecuted with greater energy than at present.\"  Because there were few United States war-ships in Brazil, American smugglers easily ran in cargoes, in spite of the prohibitory law.  Ships often used the flag of the United States to conceal acts of piracy.  When Brazil's trade declined, Cuba's trade greatly increased, and the illegal trading continued until British enforcement and further diplomacy finally ended the Atlantic trade in the 1860s.

Men like Stewart and Tweed invested in new construction projects throughout the city, which in turn brought more people into the city.  Meanwhile, New York's horse-drawn street cars, already carrying over 35 million passengers a year by 1858, were littering the streets with horse manure; early elevated trains were quickly filling to capacity and blocking sunlight and ventilation of the streets along which they ran; and immigrants continued to poor into the city's Lower East Side, almost 400,000 in 1873 alone.  The city needed new and innovative ideas to solve its problems and a number of interesting solutions came before the New   York state legislature.  One proposal to alleviate the crowded streets was the depressed Arcade Railway, which would have run along Broadway before branching out to the East and West Sides.  The plan, as portrayed in a color lithograph in the New York Public Library's Moving Uptown Exhibition, also called for the conversion of the cellars of street-level buildings into new subterranean shops to line the railway at an estimated cost of 2,296,950.00 per mile.  ","Extensive coverage by the New York Times shows that the Arcade Railway was opposed from its inception by A.T. Stewart who feared construction would disrupt the business of his department store.  The proposition was also opposed by Boss Tweed, who had introduced legislation to the senate for a pneumatic tube transit system just one day before the introduction of the Arcade bill.  While Tweed would have received large kickbacks from the pneumatic line, the Arcade line, which would have alleviated crowding and decreased travel time for many of his constituents, would not have been in the back pocket of the Tammany Hall political machine. ","The construction of an underground line was feasible for nineteenth century engineers, but was almost twice as expensive as an elevated line.  The Arcade railway would have required considerable alteration of sewage, water, and gas lines in the city, and would have caused major disruptions to street traffic during construction.  Despite construction complications, the Arcade idea was extremely popular both with the masses and with state legislatures.  Stewart and Tweed were influential men however; Stewart held protest meetings at his department store and led a delegation of concerned business owners to the governor's mansion, meanwhile Tweed manipulated New York politics to dissuade the project's popularity.  Their tactics worked as the bill passed through the legislature four times, only to be vetoed by Governor Hoffman, and New York's first subway, the IRT, only opened after the turn of the century."],"display_date":"1865 - 1875","search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":82,"tag":"A T Stewart"},{"id":134,"tag":"Boss Tweed"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4538,"title":"To free, or not to free.

Her neighbors frantically stand at her side, their eyes darting back and forth across the busy streets looking for the lost little ones.  Finally, what seems like hours later, there is a banging at the tenement door.  It is a New York City policeman, toting the lost children by the hands.  Historical photographer Lewis Wickes Hine captured this emotional moment in a flash.  ","    Living in the Lower East Side in the early 1900s was a very dangerous undertaking, especially for children.  There was disease, gang fighting, murder, and fast and unpredictable street traffic.  Landlords let such dangerous activities continue in and around their buildings, as long as their tenants were paying the rent.  ","    Immigrants often encountered diseases both in their journey to and in America that they had not previously encountered.  These diseases flourished in the unsanitary and overpopulated conditions of the tenements.  There was very little access to fresh air, and children were forced to find places to play in dirty alley ways, often among trash and refuse.  ","    The neighborhood in which people lived became their identity.  Children innocently walking with their friends often would find their way onto another street, where it was not uncommon to be attacked just for being foreign to the neighborhood.  Immigrants frequently settled in pockets based on their nationality or race, and formed their own communities.  This segregation led to rivalries and hostile street fighting among neighborhoods, simply over these strong identities of location and race.  Children were afraid to venture outside of their block for fear of who and what they might encounter.  ","    Murders were also common in the city.  Cities were a relatively new phenomenon in America, and with the help of the industrial revolution cities like New York were expanding at a rapid pace.  The expansion was so fast that law enforcement officials were having a hard time keeping up.  Therefore, it was often up to neighbors to look out for one another until police could arrive on the scene.  Children were especially vulnerable to attacks from criminals, since they were small and weak.  ","    Street traffic was dangerous.  Carts filled the streets, and laws were frequently broken.  People in the city were in a hurry, always trying to race deadlines.  Wagons were constantly swerving to miss hitting people, darting in and out of the way of other wagons, and trying to remain within the confines of the street.  It was easy for small children to get caught underneath a wagon speeding recklessly down the street, especially in the dark of night.  The rules of the road were not the same, and crosswalks were non-existent.  Laws did not protect people against the dangers of street traffic, so a constant battle existed between pedestrians and drivers.","    The photographer, Lewis Wickes Hines, believed that by capturing the hardships of life for the Lower East Side Immigrants, he could bring about reform.  He often used his images to help start reform campaigns, with help from social welfare agencies.  ","    When a child went missing, even for a short period of time, it was natural for their mother to worry if they were dead or alive.  With the dangers that Lower East Side residents faced, it was a huge relief to see your missing child appear on your doorway in the hands of a capable police officer.

the dawn of the twentieth century, women discovered exciting new things to do with their bodies.  Women fell in love with exercise and this helped heat up the debate over the healthiness of wearing corsets.  An ad carried by the December 1902 issue of Munsey's Magazine, written like a letter from \"the family doctor,\" immediately noted that articles debating the merits or faults of tight lacing often appeared in the pages of the magazine written \"by all sorts and conditions of people.\"  The writer of the article, supposedly a medical doctor, agreed that there was much to be said for both sides of the argument.  The letter stated that \"stays are useful to support the female figure if used in moderation, and they are constructed with a due regard to health.\"  The ad, disguised as a letter pertaining to medical advice, then went on to recommend Mr. Thomas' Duchess Corset because it \"adds materially to the elegance of the figure without causing any injury to the vital parts.\"","While still wearing corsets, women in America discovered the joys of exercise.  Cycling, tennis, and basic aerobics became very popular, particularly among younger women.  Gyms for ladies sprung up in larger towns, and gymnastics evolved in to an important part of the curriculum in female education.  Fashion, however, mostly refused to keep up with the trend.  Though the popularity of exercise grew, women continued to wear restrictive corsets.  Much of the country fiercely debated the merits of wearing a corset, or at least the degree of tightness to which one laced the garment.  Experts weighed in on both sides of the debate offering no clear answer.  Many doctors warned wearing a corset led to problems with internal organs, especially the reproductive system.  Other doctors called those claims overblown.","Early twentieth century corset advertising did not over look the importance of altering the female figure, but it reflected the population's growing concerns and put more emphasis on health issues, even though many companies made false claims.  The author of this ad from Munsey's Magazine failed to mention what features made the Duchess corset more safe for women to wear.  The illustration included in the advertisement, if looked at as a technical drawing, shed no light on the subject either.  Often, manufacturers made claims of improved safety but failed to deviate from the standard production of a corset model.  The Duchess corset appeared to be one of these models.","Though many groups protested claims made by corset manufacturers, they failed to stop companies from making outrageous claims about their products.  Many women learned the hard way that corsets advertised as exercise friendly or more medically sound than past models showed little, if any, difference from corset models already on the market.  The false advertising continued as long as companies sold corsets and left the job of scrutinizing claims to the consumer.","<a

Today it is not that big of a deal that a black man is running for president, or for any office in the government.  However, one hundred and fifty years ago, a black man was not even considered a person, much less someone who could run for political office, especially Secretary of State.  Fredrick Douglass, a former slave, was about to change all that.  Facing much persecution, he ran for the office Secretary of State of New York in 1855.  This idea had been opposed by many.  As it is said in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"the whole thing is supremely ridiculous and can only issue in increasing the feeling in New York against this class of people.\"  Most did not think or believe that a black man should be allowed to hold such a position.","Douglass's race would be a big issue in his run for office.  In the mid 1800's a black person was not considered a whole person, much less a candidate for a government office.  Under the Constitution an African American was only considered three-fifths of a person, and was sold like property.  Also, most African Americans had limited access to education.  As a former slave, Douglass taught himself how to read and write in many different ways.  He educated himself and then escaped to freedom.  After he became free, Douglass became an abolitionist, fighting to end slavery for all blacks.  He would play a huge role as one of the few abolitionists who had actually been through slavery before.  This would help him in his run for office.  It allowed people to know his name, and know what he stood for before he ran.    ","Douglass's run for high office brought him a lot of unwanted attention, though.  The more people who became informed of Douglass's goal, the more people who would try to stop his progress.  It is written in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"if the Negroes cannot vote, they can be voted for and if under a social ban, they can be ennobled.\"  But since blacks could not vote yet, Douglass had to rely on whites to vote him into office, and the chances of a white man voting for a former slave, or any black man, seemed impossible.  Although Douglass did not receive the position of Secretary of State that he longed for, he did write books about his life.  He wrote about his thoughts, his slavery, and his freedom using what education he gathered through the years.  After documented his life as a slave and made aware of many of the brutal things that slaves had to do, he used his writings to help end slavery."],"display_date":"October 1, 1855","search_date":"1855-10-01","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"American Civilizations to 1877","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":20,"school_id":9}},{"id":4564,"title":"African Slave Trade in the United States","course_id":20,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-04-01","end_date":"1857-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The United States Congress outlawed the African slave trade in 1808, but there were some who still took part in the slave trade, knowing it was illegal.

Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton launched the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, women did not have the right to vote on factors that affected their lives.  In addition, the majority of women did not have jobs outside the home.  In the home, society expected a woman to keep her household running seamlessly.  However, restrictions placed on women branched into other areas beyond social expectations.  While performing the roles assigned to them by society, Victorian fashion expected women to maintain specific hemlines and necklines.  The clothing that women wore took restriction to another level, and the corset led the way.","The difficulty of performing daily tasks as well as health concerns soon led to the formation of rational dress societies and movements across the Western Hemisphere.  Many of the members simultaneously fought for the right of women to vote, and encouraged them to choose clothing more appropriate for healthy lifestyles.  The rational dress voices represented a minority at the time this trade card was printed.  The fight to loosen the corset raged for several decades, but by the time women won the right to vote in America they were able to show up to polling places in much more comfortable clothing.","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img012.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img012.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img013.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img013.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>"],"display_date":1885,"search_date":"1885-07-02","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":198,"tag":"corsets"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4572,"title":"A Bounty Hunter&#39;s Execution","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-18","end_date":"1865-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An article appeared in the <em>Altoona Tribune</em> on February 18, 1865, detailing the execution of James Delvlin, accused of bounty hunting.

In July of 1863, New York City became engulfed in a wave of mob violence that swept through the city. Irish immigrants made up the majority of the rioters in opposition to the Enrollment Act of Conscription set forth earlier that year by President Abraham Lincoln. The rioters did not believe that they should have to fight in a war that they did not hold a substantial stake in. The Draft Riot of 1863, as it would later be called, raged in New York from July 13 to July 16 , eventually it was quelled by the Union Army. However, the riot would not be stopped before the death of around 100 civilians and numerous casualties had taken place.","Before the Battle of Gettysburg, the Union Army had a growing need for more troops. Due to this shortage of men, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Enrollment Act of Conscription in March of 1863. Lincoln called for nearly 300,000 more men to bolster Union forces. By mid July of 1863, the time when New York received its first draft notices, the Battle of Gettysburg had just been fought. The horrors of the battle shocked many New Yorkers, causing them not to want to enlist in the military. ","The unskilled laborers of New York, Irish and African American alike, did not have the capabilities to pay their way out of military service. The Irish became enraged at the fact that they did not have a way out of the draft. The Irish believed that they should not have to go to war for a group of people, whom they did not care for. For these reasons, the Irish rioted, and in so doing, directed much of their violence towards the African American population in New York City.  William A. Hall, an established member of New York society wrote to Montgomery Blair, member of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet stating, \"We have had…a bloody riot and the destruction of large amounts of property…\" Oddly enough, Hall goes on to tell Blair not to recall the draft in New York City, even though it incited the riot. ","The Draft Riots in New York, born out of unskilled labor competition between African Americans and Irish immigrants, in conjunction with Irish discontent at being forced to participate in the draft without any feasible way out, raged for three days ending nearly 1,000 people having been either killed or wounded.

By this point, the war had only been going on for one year and civilians already had begun to grow weary of its costs.

One of the complaints concerning this matter appeared in <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">The</em> <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">New York Times </em>in January of 1862 in a letter to the editor. The author of the letter asked the editor of the times, \"Will you please tell me and about forty others if there is any way…letters can be sent to the seceded States[sic].\" The author then followed up his or her question by stating that he or she had \"…relations there that I would be glad to know are alive only.\"  The author of the letter could have been either male or female since the letter had been written in New York, where education had been emphasized as a desirable trait for the population at large, as opposed to just men or women,  in pre-war and war times as part of the Whig party platform.","               The letter to the editor from an unhappy and concerned New York citizen raised the issue of civil liberties in war time. As historian Byron Price remarks, \"The censorship process is essential to the conduct of war for two reasons: First…keeping the enemy from knowing what we are doing on the home front...Second…censorship helps us learn what the enemy is doing. Examination of mail and cablegrams…turn up vital information…\" The Union certainly believed in censorship as a necessary instrument of war and enacted it through field orders, in this case by 77 year old Union General John Wool. Union citizens who wished to contact southern relatives could only do so by, \"…direct permission of the military authorities, and under flags of truce… Gen. Wool…will probably have them examined and forwarded…if there appears to be nothing objectionable…\" Union citizens had to submit their letters to the authorities for inspection. The President did not condone the censoring of mail and media. He was quoted as saying, \"…you do not…comprehend the danger of abridging the liberties of the people…\" The orders for censorship, given by the commanding officer in a specific region, based on the reasons listed above, proved to be a difficulty for many Union and Confederate citizens wishing to communicate with their relatives on the opposite side of the conflict.

Leading up to the riot, there had been a rivalry between the English actor Edward Macready and the American actor Edwin Forrest.   Baker wrote that this rivalry began when Forrest believed that Macready sabotaged his recent tour of England.  The nativist trend in the United States at the time did not help Macready's popularity in New York as most of Forrest's fans were poor working class citizens.  \"The quarrel, then, waxed warmer and warmer, until it has ended in a fearful riot, in which thousands of excited people engaged, incurring a serious loss of life.\"  The May 10 riot was the second time that theatergoers tried to force Macready from the stage.  Historian Bill Kauffman writes that on May 7 they had succeeded by throwing anything possible onto the stage including vegetables and chairs.  Afterwards leading New York citizens apologized to Macready and convinced him to stay and perform Macbeth again on May 10 by promising such an incidence would not occur again. Meanwhile, Forrest's fans circulated handbills asking if Americans or English should rule the city.  In response to threat of violence a large number of policemen were stationed at the theater for the performance.      ","  Starting around 6:30 PM and continuing throughout the performance a crowd began gathering outside the theater.  The performance started off calm enough, but erupted into violence after police arrested four audience members and confined them in a small room.  The arrested men attempted to set the room on fire so were placed in irons.   When news of the arrests spread the mob gathered outside exploded.  The police were soon overwhelmed by the mob so the military was called in.  A cavalry company arrived, but was also driven off.  Then the National Guard came and was attacked by the mob, but eventually was able to force their way to the theater.   The soldiers fired over the mob's heads after the captain was struck down with a large stone.  When this did not stop the mob from attacking, the soldiers then fired three rounds of ball cartridges dispersing the crowd.  More troops were called in and two artillery pieces were loaded with grape shot directly in front of Aster Place Theater.  By 11:30 pm the crowd had dispersed, carrying off the dead and wounded.   ","Both Baker and Kauffman agree that twenty-two rioters were killed instantly and more soon died from their wounds. Baker goes on to say that this riot sent shock waves through New York's upper class.  Hardly any of them believed that shooting was necessary to save Macready or Astor Place from destruction.

It also showed how eventual abolition in the United States would be a failure to both Southern States and Northern States.","Throughout the nineteenth century, the islands of the West Indies abolished slavery, which resulted in catastrophic consequences for their economic structures. Like his anti-abolition peers, Van Evrie believed that the fundamental nature of black people was responsible for the dramatic decay of economies in the West Indies. He maintained that, once freed from their slave ties, \"negroes\" only fell back upon their tendency to idleness, returned to the \"savagism of their African ancestors,\" and converted back to their \"heathen\" way of life. Van Evrie used statistical elements to show that the abolition of slavery in islands such as Jamaica and Haiti resulted in the ruin of their economy and trade, the return to uncultivated wilderness of the lands, and the \"desolation\" of the plantations installed by the colonist countries.  ","For Van Evrie, \"freed negroes,\" as \"inferior human beings,\" would be a burden for American laborers in many ways: they would live on the labor of White people, stop producing goods and therefore generate an increase of price for these goods. They would not be consumers of northern goods any more, and they would increase crime and pauperism in the States.  He therefore encouraged American people to reflect upon these elements before abolishing slavery. Destroying slavery in the West Indies and in the United States would be equivalent to destroying hundreds of farmers, or of laborers.","Van Evrie claimed his tract about \"Free Negroism…\" to be a response to the \"innumerable\" abolitionist tracts published in the early 1860s. He wanted to give an answer to the \"false and pernicious doctrines\" spread by the North for decades, and tried to awaken the consciousness of people of the North about the good of slavery. As part of the anti-abolition movement and of the South, Van Evrie remained concerned about the election of anti-slavery candidate Abraham Lincoln. According to the historian John David Smith, Van Evrie was very representative of the \"anti Negro propaganda\", and was the \"first professional racist in American History.\" In his pamphlet Van Evrie responded to the concerns of the middle classes, looking for social stability in a changing society, giving them arguments against changing the state of things."],"display_date":1862,"search_date":"1862-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":176,"tag":"trade relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4701,"title":"Vietnam Veteran's PTSD Leads to Suicide","course_id":26,"status":"P","start_date":"12/2/83","end_date":"12/2/83","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Karl Lerchenmuller suffered from nightmares and flashbacks and would often disappear into the woods with his firearm for days at a time.

Despite prosecution and jail time he stood behind the ideas of his 1832 work <em>Fruits of Philosophy</em>. The book was deemed obscene for its discussion of sex for pleasure and birth control methods. Knowlton saw sexual desire as a passion that started in the nerves of the genital organs and extended to the brain. He saw sexual desire as natural, but realized that no “sensations” could be excited without causing some kind of negative reproduction. In the case of sex negative consequences included having children out of wedlock and contracting venereal diseases. However, Knowlton also believed that man was gifted with the ability to discover ways to prevent these negative occurrences. If mankind desired sexual gratification and could prevent the disagreeable aspects of engaging in such activity, Knowlton believed there was no reason not to engage.","He advocated the use of four types of “checks” to limit the negative consequences of sex. The first was entire withdrawal by the male. But this was not his preferred method due to the loss of some enjoyment. The second check was a sponge that had been dipped in chloride of soda and then inserted into the female’s vagina. This was agreeable since it was effective at managing venereal diseases. The third method was the use of a thin skin to cover the male sexual organ. This was objectionable on the basis of cleanliness and the expense for an item that is not reusable. The fourth check was what Knowlton advocated as the best option. This practice involved syringing the vagina directly after sex. It could be used after the sexual act, was very clean, and the materials were cheap and easily obtained.","The ideas put forth in <em>Fruits of Philosophy</em> were an innovation in the nineteenth century. This book was the first text published in the United States to deal with contraception from an empirical medical standpoint. As Knowlton published new editions of the book the descriptions of the anatomy of the sexual organs and their functions became more elaborate. The book represented cutting edge knowledge concerning women’s bodies and reproduction. Knowlton moved the discussion of sex from a moral issue to the realm of physiology. He was one of the founders of a framework that historian Helen Horowitz has called \"reform physiology,\" which was concerned with the functions of the reproductive organs and recommending healthy lifestyles. Sexual desire was then recognized as being part of the mind, in the communications between the nerves and the brain. The nineteenth century did see a decrease in the average number of children born to white women. Couples sought to have fewer children for reasons such as their new urban lifestyles, the sense of responsibility brought by the concept of republican motherhood, and ideas of romantic love that separated sex from conception. These goals could be achieved with the advice of doctors', such as Knowlton, describing how to prevent sex from resulting in birth."],"display_date":1832,"search_date":"1832-07-01","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":364,"tag":"sex"},{"id":362,"tag":"contraception"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Sex and Culture in the 19th-century United States","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":40,"school_id":2}},{"id":4914,"title":"<strong>Purifying the Ballots: Women’s Entrance into The Political Sphere</strong>","course_id":41,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1868-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a society where women were becoming the majority, they still stood bounded by political and social restraints. Rather than seeing this as a setback, American women grew more aware of their limitations and demanded the right to vote. <em>The Social Elevation of Woman</em>, refers to a time when patriarchy was most apparent and women’s voting rights remained undervalued. Men of the early nineteenth century, feared that women would gain such power in society, which might later jeopardize their status. On the other hand, some believed that women, viewed as the picture of <em>perfection</em> and <em>purity</em>, would become tainted when coming into contact with men in the voting polls. The article shows a clear shift towards a more <em>gender equal </em>society. While many men decided to avoid this claim, they knew that <em>old</em> ideals were being left behind and that women were now taking on the role of both the domestic and intellectual head of households. Not all men disagreed with the right of women’s vote in government, believing that this can only empower them to help cultivate <em>better</em> <em>dinners</em> at the table. This meant that through the intellectual awareness gained within social involvement, women could also enhance their roles within the household and bring to the table more intellectual conversations, while expanding both their social and domestic skills.","Meanwhile, in Elsa Barkley Brown’s, “<em>To Catch the Vision of Freedom”, </em>included in the book <em>Unequal Sisters</em>, she poses the idea of what it means to be freed, experiencing full political right. Freed women, while sometimes being accepted into society, were denied many rights, including the moral right to vote. Suffrage, as presented in the reading, was thought of as a God-given right for women and that there should be a clear distinction between the <em>right</em> to suffrageand the <em>right </em>for liberty. While many white Southern men experienced the right to vote, freed women were denied such liberty, showing that they never reached a point of full freedom. As the reading suggests, that since much of the field work was done by women, who were left to take care of the home, agriculture, and religious duties while their husbands were away, could have used their time more wisely by participating in the polls. Simply, a woman engaging just in controversial conversation was not enough to compensate for fair political participation.","Both readings, focused on women’s fight towards gaining voting rights, help support the idea that voting was not merely a right for one class nor one gender, but a universal privilege. Women also helped <em>purify</em> the polls, with their moral and trustworthy decisions. Women proved to be successful both intellectually and domestically, and were ready to take advantage of their full rights as lawful citizens.

In the speech that followed, Truth challenged the idea that men should treat all women the same, “That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place, and ain't I a woman?” Truth wanted to challenge the idea and the general understanding of a “woman” and womanhood to the conference. She believed the term should expand to include black women. She believed that every woman deserved to be treated with respect by men of all color no matter the color of the women’s skin.","Sojourner Truth also known as Isabella Baumfree was an African American woman and a slave. She was a young teenager who was sold to John D. Dumont. Seventeen years later, Isabella escaped Dumont’s control and became a runaway slave. After traveling family to family for two years, she found herself in New York City. The Anti-Slavery Act, that was passed, allowed Truth to be free. She was able to sue her former owner for selling her son into slavery. In 1843, Isabella changed her name to Sojourner Truth and preached in New England about women’s rights and slavery.  Later on in her life she helped other slaves find freedom and success in society. Generally women who were forced into slavery at an early age did not have an education, Truth helped the women learn how to succeed in the outside world. Black women in society were seen with little respect and a low social status. Twenty years after Truth’s moving speech, historians felt “the silence had been broken and the veil was raised to reveal the long obscured and ignored activism and experiences of one half of the black population in America”[1]. When historians look back on Sojourner Truth’s speech, they realize she stated a radical idea for the mid 1800’s because she proposed and questioned why black women were not treated with the same respect as white women."," ","[1] Clark Hine, Darlene. \"Ar'n't I A Woman?: Female Slaves In the Plantation South-Twenty Years After.\" (2007): 14."," "],"display_date":"1850 - 1860","search_date":"1855-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":582,"tag":"Ain't I a Woman?"},{"id":581,"tag":"Anti-Slavery Act"},{"id":580,"tag":"Sojourner Truth"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History: New York, New York","school":"Stonehill College","course_id":27,"school_id":22}},{"id":4963,"title":"An Influx of Irish Immigrant: Young Women arrive in New York","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The woman from Ireland looked around the chaos on Ellis Island visibly upset, as the immigration officials accused her of giving them the wrong name of the person picking her up.  Migrations to the United States “did not always occur without problems or disruptions and occasionally the colleen arrived with no one to greet her.”[1]  On April 30, 1897, The New York Times published an article that focused on the influx of immigrants from Ireland.  The ultimate goal of these immigrants was to find work that paid a decent salary and offered better opportunities than the jobs available back home.","While the workers at Ellis Island extolled the “promise of better times in this country”, numerous Irish women faced fear and confusion upon arrival.  When it came to immigration, a great deal of the chaos was due to the miscommunication or misinformation exchanged between individuals.  “Immigrants frequently failed to find one another because they constantly changed residencies, expecially if they were poor, and because Irish women continued using their maiden names after marriage.”[2]  In the 1897 newspaper article, a woman named Cassidy was looking for a lady named Maggie Molloy, but was told that her name was not on the list.  Maggie Molloy’s name was in fact on the list, however due to the miscommunication, Cassidy was very upset.[3]  Events like this were not uncommon, and this is what caused much of the confusion on Ellis Island.","The Irish invaded America by the thousands from the late 1800’s into the early 1900’s. Much of the incentive to leave Ireland was due to the unfavorable living conditions in the Irish countryside According to the Irish who remained in Ireland, many of the women were frustrated by the male dominated agricultural society and had left their homes in hopes of finding luck in the United States.  These oversea journeys were life threatening, but foreigners were willing to take a chance.  To the immigrants, anything was better than what they were leaving back home.[4]","A portion of the women immigrating to the United States via Ellis Island had their voyages paid for by other relatives already living in America; however, it was not uncommon for the father to emigrate first, earn money, and then send it back home to pay for his other family member’s voyages or for a family to emigrate as a group or for single members to travel alone.","These girls faced many difficulties in America, due to the fact that they were uprooted from their homes in Ireland.  Previously, these Irish women were accustomed to working around the house and caring for others, but life in America was going to be much different.  Once the young women arrived, they needed to begin to search for work immediately.  Coming from an area where most people were agriculturalists, their transition to an area in the heart of New York City was drastically different from their familiar surroundings.","Of all the different groups of immigrants, Irish women were of the greatest amount.  This difference was due to the “emergence of the modern Irish family structure”  With the newly evolving land and family forms that were coming about, there was a decrease in the number of children emigrating.  Between the years of 1852 to 1921 the median age for female immigrants was 21.2 years old.  This age was “younger than the median age of marriage”, and therefore explains the reason why so many of the immigrants got married upon arriving in America.[5]","“Emigration was the end of peasant live in Europe; it was also the beginning of life in America”.[6]  Ireland depended on their crops for survival, and therefore life was miserable at home for many of the Irish families.  Providing for everyone became difficult, and as a result many Irish left their familiar hometowns to start a new life in America.  The decision to come to America marked a huge milestone in an individual’s life, because they were leaving their native land and putting their lives at risk. Assimilating to life in America was not going to be easy, and immigrants needed to be taught about the way of life in America."," ","[1] Diner, Professor Hasia R.. \"The Search for Bread: Patterns of Female Migration.\" In <em>Erin's Daughters in America: Irish Immigrant Women in the Nineteenth Century (The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science)</em>.

Here the four presidential candidates dance with members of their supposed respective constituencies.”  This political cartoon, along with many others, shows the main differences between the four major candidates and what the main issues of the time were. In the end, Abraham Lincoln proved to be victorious.  The <em>Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association</em> says that Lincoln was able to

loss of untouched and pristine nature began in nineteenth century America in the age growing urbanization and industrialization, yet a few places remained, allowing Americans to discover themselves in nature.  An 1854 illustration in Richards’ <em>American Scenery:  Illustrated</em> called “Lake in the Adirondacks, New York” revealed that these places did still exist in the nineteenth century.  The illustration showed one man fishing in a lake in the Adirondack Mountains, surrounded by nature untouched by human hands.  The image depicted mountains, lakes, trees, rocks, and shores, with no mention of the evidence of human society growing exponentially around it.  The sun was streaming over the water, a true depiction of calm and tranquility compared to the hustle and bustle of mid-nineteenth century life.  It was a true picture of the American frontier, even though it is actually located in the urbanized Northeast.   The chapter following the image compared the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York to Broadway Street in New York City.  Visitors to the area were “…astonished that Nature should yet remain in such primitive solitude and grandeur, so near the crowded marts of commerce and the ceaseless hum of human life and enterprise.”","Environmentalism was born in America in the nineteenth century as Americans began to feel the loss of what was once “the final frontier.”  As the American machine was developing its conquest of nature, the idea of preservation became prevalent in society.  Americans looked to protect undisturbed nature in the early nineteenth century before conservation became the dominant course in America.  Environmental thinking like this led to the creation of national and recreational parks in order to preserve nature.  The Adirondack Parkwas created in 1892 by the New York legislature to preserve the wilderness of state and protect it from modernization and an expanding population.  This act protected the area of loggers, and forever preserved from loggers that were destroying one of the few areas remaining that was different from the growingly urbanized and commercialized world.  In the 1800s, Urbanization was destroying the natural world that was viewed to be beneficial both for its own good and for its spiritual impact on people.  While the wilderness of the Adirondacks was unfit for economic and agricultural uses, it was rich in more than physical things; the loneliness of the area was both health-giving and soul-cheering.  This image spoke of American culture and society, as it moved toward urban and consumer life and away from the natural world.  Citizens of cities in nineteenth century America would have been unable to survive in the mountains of northern New York, even though in reality going from the city to the country should be from a more complex life to simplicity.  As Henry David Thoreau wrote in his book, Walden, “…as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less

changing role of nineteenth century women from a worker on the farm to a woman of society was reflected in fashion transformations, with fashion magazines that spoke directly to women, stating that “every lady loves it.”  Magazine stressed the novelty and desirability of the clothing pictured.  MME Demorest’s Illustrated Portfolio of the Fashions was a popular biannual women’s magazine, costing individuals ten cents.  Directions were given in the magazine for measurements and the type and amount of fabric; patterns were then sent from New York City for ten to thirty cents each.   The magazine was delivered all over the country, directly from the nation’s fashion capital, New York City.  The 1875 spring and summer edition of the magazine pictured items such as demitrain skirts, overskirts, basques, polonaises, bonnets, and aprons.  The fashions showed women what was “in” and what to wear, what was “useful, practical, and reliable information.”  All styles were elegant, meant for high society women; women pictured were standing, acting prim and proper.  The magazine illustrated the fact that appearing well-dressed was very important to people in the nineteenth century; many were willing to have inferior homes and diets to wear symbols of supposed status and success in society.  The creation of fashion styles demonstrated the more general change in America to a consumer culture and market society.","Even as early as the 1830s in America, \"the lady of fashion had arrived.\"  As women moved from the fields to the home, attire accommodated to the new expectations of the female gender.  Many women had acquired a new aversion to working and managing household affairs, creating terrible wives, as this was the expectation of women at this time.  All of the styles and suggested materials were heavy, even though the styles were for the spring and summer; this revealed that fashion was to make a statement, not to be comfortable or practical.  The specific magazine was sold in Greenville, South Carolina residents, and while the fashions may have made sense for New York City, they may not have been as applicable to Southern or rural women.  The magazine did not show the distinct differences between city and country that were very apparent in the nineteenth century, only picturing the styles of the nation's fashion capital.  Also, fashion styles for girls even under the age of ten were elegant and unreasonable, if more jaunty than the women’s styles.  The magazine illustrated that women had a new role in society:  to be seen and not to work or be on the same intellectual or political level as men.  In nineteenth century society, women were to be, “the graces of purity, gentleness, kindness, modesty, constancy, sincerity, resignation, and of a meek and quiet spirit are your bright ornaments.”  American women's fashion also depicted the wider changes in nineteenth century society from the ideal of republican simplicity to aristocratic decadence."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New

exploration debates the larger question encompassing nineteenth century America:  do we play it safe, or take risks to gain knowledge?  Do we preserve what we have, or seek new things?  Arctic exploration is one debate that centers on these issues, and the 1873 <em>New York Tribune</em> article, “Arctic Exploration,” addresses these difficult questions.  The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of the adventurous explorers who dared to face the unknown of the Arctic Circle.  The article addresses the conflict between risk and knowledge.  Many people did not support Arctic exploration, claiming that it made prisoners of explorers and the risk was not worth the gain.  Arctic exploration in the 1870s came at the same time as the Panic of 1873, and many believed that money should go to things closer to home with more tangible results.  This newspaper article, however, defends Arctic exploration, stating that Arctic exploration can satisfy our natural “thirst for knowledge.”  Science, knowledge, and experience do not come from the majority of Americans that were becoming comfortable in their urban lives; instead, they must accept and support the brave souls who were willing to face the Arctic wilderness for answers.  And often, it involved looking forward; results from expeditions often seemed unimportant at the time, but the writer claims that one had to look to the future as grounds for Arctic exploration.","The nineteenth century is often noted for Western expansion in the United States, but many also began to look beyond the Americas.  Arctic exploration of the nineteenth century can be compared to the twentieth century’s space race, as quests involved competition and distinction, as well as tragedy and failure.  It is true that many men died, many ships were lost and, on the surface, discoveries were not major or life-changing.  Perhaps the compulsion for Arctic exploration comes from an “Arctic Fever,” and that explorers felt and urge to go into the unknown against better judgment and with little chance of knowledge or success as a result.  And yet the article describes the “softening” of Americans, from the tough and adventurous people they once were.  The drive and spirit of Ulysses that brought people to America to better their lives is gone in most people.  The fear of death comes into play, as it often does in the nineteenth century.  \"Shall adventure be given up or the field of discovery abandoned because there's peril in it because some men suffer and others die for sake of it!\"  The writer claims that death comes to all, and that dying in pursuit of a greater truth in the unexplored North is worth the risk.  Arctic explorers were men of the future, who moved society forward and lived life through risks as all Americans should.  And it all comes down to the idea of creating a history worth remembering; without risk, there is no gain."],"display_date":"May 13,

themselves cut off from the traditional support of family and neighbors.  Feeling that it was necessary to create new forms of life in the modern metropolis, many turned to journalism as a venue for connecting with the world around them.  As much as public life was flourishing, the rise of the private spectrum also sought nationwide attention.  The power, prerogative, and sanctity of private property encouraged the spread of new ideas about business organization into almost every enterprise, large and small."," ","Mr. Paul’s personal testimony a","The transformation that took place in New York City was first a work of the imagination.  Every structure in this newly developing metropolis added to the good or bad impression of the city dwellers; all who ambitiously set out to erect new buildings were either enhancing or deteriorating public taste.  It was linkages between landscape, culture, and power that informed the discourse of the city building, and behind the design of the new city was a moral environmentalism, a belief that natural and built environments exert profound influence over the ideals and capacities that make of the city life.  American civilization would now be tested in urban areas as the drama of legitimization had shifted scenes.  Imbedded in the motives to create and develop a vast metropolis was a sense of spirituality and moral ideology.  The growth and progress of New York City began in the imagination of ambitious city-dwellers devoted to the idea of progress and advancement.  Though the whole process was one of a trade-off between the old and the new, most individuals of the age believed that given a chance to grow, New York City could become the imperial metropolis of the world.","bout the physical and intangible changes brought about through urbanization reflect the large scale transformations that cities were undergoing across the country.  Though his story represents the negative personal effects of urbanization, economists and businessmen had much to gain through the rise of the city.  This change was both palpable and visible, and in Mr. Paul’s case, provoked a long inhabitant of a city to recognize his own yard as

issues, events, and ideas were spread and divided among many American journals, newspapers, and periodicals, but in June of 1850 Harper & Brothers of New York sought to “remedy this evil” and provide all of this information in one place for anyone who wished to read it.  The firm introduced Harper’s New Monthly Magazine as the first general interest magazine in America.  They prefaced the issue with a quick word to their readers, explaining the reasoning and need for such a magazine in the United States.  The idea was to “place within the reach of the great mass of the American people the unbounded treasures of the Periodical Literature of the present day.”  They wished to bring the most current works of the most brilliant and innovative minds into the lives of as many as possible, offering their magazine monthly for only three dollars a year.  This was an attempt to keep minds fresh and informed in an age when so many things seemed to be happening and changing so quickly.","Great Britain and France had been in the practice of publishing periodicals for years, with growing popularity.  Harper & Brothers was trying to keep America up to date.  All of the brightest minds and all of their greatest works had been enriching European culture for years and Americans wanted the same for themselves.  Harper’s was a rather liberal arts publication, covering “varied intellectual movements of this most stirring and productive age.”  Scientific discoveries, political activity, and mechanical inventions were to be found among its pages with the fine art and literature, a regular Renaissance magazine. ","Harper & Brothers included the most recent information, not only from America, but from Europe, too.  It was an innovative concept and a way to advance and improve American culture and society.  By catering to “any class of readers…for any kind of reading,” the firm was able to deliver a magazine with a value “so much beyond its price…into the hands or the family circle of every intelligent citizen of the United States.”  Every copy of the issue in June sold and half a year later there were up to 50,000 readers.","Initial issues quickly shifted from the notable European works to the fresh American pieces.  Writers such as Horace Greeley, Horatio Alger, Stephen Douglas, and Mark Twain put forth their ideas for America.  During the 1850s the country was enjoying the access to printed materials that the printing press allowed and the spread of railroads assisted.  Culture was becoming a possible investment, rather than the bare necessities of yesteryears.  Many authors and artists were working to accelerate this process, and Harper’s New Monthly Magazine offered a brilliant and accessible means of doing so."],"display_date":"June

senseless waste of time, effort, and resources by middle-class women. If a woman is not wealthy, attempting to keep up with the latest trends robs her of her money and subsequently her peace of mind. Staying abreast of and setting the fashion trends of the day is a task, a responsibility, a job of the wealthiest women.  Tytler instructs the women of her time to dress within their means and even instructs her readers to wear clothes out of affection for that is when the most joy will be gained from their use.  If stylishness is sought after just so that a woman looks better than those around her, garnering more attention while walking down the street, then she displays very bad taste. "," A woman naturally desires to have all things nice and pleasant, but laboring after an elusive fashion ideal that is constantly shifting leads to a lack of commitment to that which is normally within a middle-class woman’s sphere.  According to Tytler, this includes “honest hospitality, dignity, and loyal-brotherly kindness,” among others.  This emphasis on the household labor of care was a mainstay of the cult of domesticity that redefined women’s roles in the household in the nineteenth century.   A woman’s role was no longer that of a breadwinner for the household but of the nurturing caretaker that performed her duties as a mother, wife, and runner of the house out of and with love and affection.  A middle-class women, therefore, should focus on her “natural” duties in the home instead of looking outward, wasting time, money, and her talents which should be utilized elsewhere."],"display_date":"1870 - 1871","search_date":"1870-12-31","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":718,"tag":"Women in the Household"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5046,"title":"Marriage in Margaret Fuller's \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\"","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the nineteenth century, one female author stood out as a voice for women during a time when many were not acknowledged.  Margaret Fuller wrote “Woman in the Nineteenth Century” and spoke with a voice for every woman who lived during the nineteenth century.  In particular, Fuller had an especially critical view toward marriage.  She explained that the idea of marriage “has been inculcated on women for centuries, that men not only have stronger passions than they, but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share of even understand”.  She further explains that woman are expected to tell their husbands everything on their mind, and when they begin to show signs of “coldness or withdrawal” the wife is then labeled “wicked”.","The role of women gained increased attention during the nineteenth century, especially in women’s movements throughout the country.  As described by Carole Shammas in “A history of household government in American,” the U.S. was “the site of the first full-fledged uprising of female dependents…There were a few like Margaret Fuller, the Boston intellectual, who would maintain that if they wanted, “women should be sea captains!” but the primary objectives of the first feminists were not equal opportunities in the job market or in the political arena.” Shammas explained that the reason for their outrage was for others to acknowledge “the empowerment of women in households”.  During the nineteenth century, women desired to be seen as influential members of society instead of the “housewife” label with the expectations to constantly serve their husband.","Fuller asserted her confidence in understanding women and marriage when she explained that the married woman viewed men as “wild beasts” but actually view them all the same.  The unwed women were often told by the married women that if they were in their position and married to a man, “they would not expect continence or self-government from them”.  Women’s expectations were high for marriage, but in reality they received little in return, expected to run the household, and were taken advantage of."," "," "],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5054,"title":"America's First Fashion Magazine","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-11-02","end_date":"1867-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The issues discussed in the first issue of Harper’s Bazar are not different from concerns of twenty-first century women.

The design of the magazine title was quite different from today’s title in part because today, the magazine spells Bazar with two A’s instead of one. The font of the title was also quite different because it was written in an old English style and had ivy intertwining between the letters.

Although, this issue looked more similar to Harper’s Bazaar’s wedding issue than the regular issue, it still deals with one of many women’s concerns.

However, the biggest difference between  attire of the nineteenth century and the twenty-first century did not lie on the outside. The major differences were what the women wore underneath their dresses. Most women had to wear a chemise, corset, petticoat, and crinoline something that was adapted from the females of  English high-class society.","Although, the United States was going through several important events during the nineteenth century, the establishment of the first American fashion magazine shows that twenty-first century women are not that different from the nineteenth century women. The cover exemplifies that everyone needs an outlet to get away. Even if people are going through difficult times, such as war, they want something else to focus their attention on.

The magazine took on the daunting task and discussed marriage in its first issue on November 2, 1867. The first issue contained several articles that discussed various concerns of nineteenth century women. But, its most controversial article was entitled, “Expensive Matrimony.” The piece was one of the firsts of its time because during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, most newspapers and magazines did not discuss matrimony.","The author contradicted the idea that the reason for the decrease in marriage is women and their bad spending habits. She said it was wrong to blame women for the decrease in marriage rates because there was no statistical data to support the idea. She believed that men, in fact had worse spending habits than women did. The author stated that although women did tend to spend on clothing, men spent on larger, pricier items. She also stated that when it came down to it, men were greedier than women and men would put money before family. Men were more business oriented and would choose their careers and money over anything else. She said that since men usually focused more on their careers than family, they were more to blame for the decrease in marriage than women.","She also explains that not all women had bad spending habits. Some women were good with finances and saving money and it was wrong to simply assume that all women were bad with money. The author made several more valid points, such as the fact that women had self control and could stop shopping and spending money on clothing if need be.","The article demonstrated that marriage rates had been decreasing since the nineteenth century.

Porter was a man of many talents.  Born in 1792 in Massachusetts but moving to Maine when he was nine, Porter was apprenticed to a shoemaker by his family, but he was far too restless for that kind of life.  After leaving home he played the fiddle, traveled to Hawaii, taught dancing school, had 15 children by two wives and became one of the most accomplished mural painters of his day.  However, his true avocation was inventing.  Among his creations (he had over 100 patents) were a fire alarm, signal telegraph, fog whistle, washing machine, and a revolving rifle.  Showing the kind of business sense that has rendered his name obscure in the annals of American history, in 1844 Porter sold this last idea for $100 to Samuel Colt, who then used it to build his renowned firearms company.","Porter may have struck out in the weapons industry, but his contribution in the field of journalism was just as long-lasting.  He took over the <em>New York Mechanic</em> in 1841, but sold it after relocating to Boston the next year in order to work as an electroplater.  Back in New York City, on August 28, 1845 he put out the first issue of <em>Scientific American</em>, a magazine that survives to this day.  In his first editorial, Porter gives the goal of the new journal as “to furnish the intelligent and liberal working man and those who delight in the development of the beauties of Nature…with a paper that will instruct while it diverts and amuses them, and will retain its excellence and value, when political and ordinary newspapers are thrown aside and forgotten.”","The first issue certainly made a good effort on these promises.  There are, as might be expected, scientific articles such as a discussion of the first principles of mechanics and another on how two compounds mixed together could make a very different color than each separately, a fact no doubt related to Porter’s artistic career.  There are also descriptions of the latest technology, improved railcars and the steamship <em>Great Britain</em>, complete with engravings.  There is a list of all of the patents recently granted.  Then there are some articles of a different bent, like the surprising assortment of poetry.  One article is entitled “Rational Religion,” that no doubt provides a distillation of Porter’s own sunny philosophy and the first in a regular theological column.  The story of a horse that is sensible enough to go by itself to the blacksmith is found between an article on lithographic painting and another on the properties of zinc.","One article that deserves of particular notice discussed the invention of one Signor Muzzi.  Muzzi claimed to have invented a method of aerial locomotion, which was basically a propelled balloon.  The author of this article dismissed the practicality of this claim with scorn, writing about how Muzzi’s plan received undue attention simply because he was Italian while a far more rational plan proposed by an American had previously been dismissed.  The vehement dismissal of Muzzi could perhaps be explained by realizing that Porter’s lifetime goal was to develop a working airship and the American referred to in this article was likely none other than himself.","Porter would devote most of his life until his death in 1884 to working on his airship plan, retaining his optimism in the face of business and technical failures.  As for the <em>Scientific American</em>, Porter sold it to two patent lawyers, Orson Desaix Munn and Alfred Ely Beach, for $800 just 10 months after the first issue was published.  He would stay on as editor for another year, but it was under their leadership that the broadsheet would begin to flourish.  Porter himself passed away in Connecticut in 1884, a man whose “eccentricity of genius” was too little appreciated in his day."],"display_date":"August 28, 1845","search_date":"1845-08-28","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW

The case was commonly known as the “Lemmon Slave Case”. The events that led to this appeal dated back to 1850. The court case brought up hard questions about slavery within the United States of America and challenged the slavery laws between the northern states and the southern states.","The events that inspired the Lemmon case began in 1852 when the Lemmon family and eight of their African American slaves traveled from the state of Virginia, where slavery was legal at the time, to the state of New York, where slavery was illegal. While the Lemmon family and their slaves were in New York City, an African American man named Louis Napoleon found the slaves owned by the Lemmon family and determined that they were being held against their will. This was illegal within New York City. So, Napoleon went to the Superior Court of New York City and filed a writ of habeas corpus, which is Latin for \"that you have the body,\" for the African American slaves. On November 6, 1852, Justice Elijah Paine granted the writ of habeas corpus for the slaves, which required Lemmon to produce his slaves before the court.","The <em>New York Times</em> article from January 24, 1860 discussed the plaintiffs’ points of argument before the Court of Appeals in the Lemmon Slave Case. The plaintiffs’ lawyer Mr. Charles O’Connor first pointed out that New York State could not forbid slavery because it was not illegal in the United States. In 1860, the Constitution of the United States did not yet have an amendment making slavery illegal. O’Conner next noted that the Judicial Department of New York State has no right to declare African American slavery illegal contrary to the law of nature. Finally, he argued that New York State could not prevent citizens of sister states, where slavery was legal, from passing through New York.","A follow-up article in the <em>New York Times</em>, dated January 26, 1860, addressed the counterarguments of the Counsel of New York, Mr. William M. Evarts. Evarts responded to O’Conner’s arguments before the court. The first point was that every human being within the state of New York was entitled to the writ of habeas corpus. The second point was that the relationship between slave owner and slave did not continue from Virginia to New York then Texas. The third and final point his argument was that travelers are bounded by the laws of the state in which they reside, no matter whether they stay one day or several years.","The State of New York Court of Appeals made its decision on the Lemmon case in March 1860. The Judges ruled 5-3 in favor of the African American slaves. One of the majority opinions was written by Judge Denio. In his opinion Denio said that some cases concerning the Commerce Clause would be able to protect slavery as property when dealing with interstate commerce but this case was not one of them. The Commerce Clause is part of the Constitution of the United States that allows the federal government to regulate interstate commerce so there is no wrong doing between states. Another member of the majority, Justice Wright, stated that the United States Constitution denied any power affecting slavery, which does not involve the Fugitive Slave Clause. This clause requires that slaves that escaped to another state to be returned back to the owner in the state from which they escaped.","The judges who favored the Lemmon family were Justices Clarke, Comstock, and Selden. Justice Clarke stated that citizens of other states traveling through New York State must be allowed to pass through with their property even if the property includes slaves. Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden also “expressed a concern at the violation of comity and justice in interstate relations wrought by the New York statue” [1]. Following the New York decision the Lemmon family appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Before the United States Supreme Court could hear the case the US Civil War started in April 1861. Then in September 1862 President Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation which freed all slaves in the United States.","In conclusion, the <em>New York Times </em>article from January 24, 1860 provides fascinating insights into the legal issues affecting slavery and interstate travel before the Civil War. This court case was part of the final stage in the United States history that triggered the Civil War and made all Americans free no matter where they came from and what color their skin was."," ","_________________","[1] Gordan, III, John D. \"The Lemmon Slave Case.\" The Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York, 2006: 1, 12."],"display_date":"January - March 1860","search_date":"1860-02-14","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":858,"tag":"habeas corpus"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":857,"tag":"Lemmon Case"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5143,"title":"Fighting Back, Lola Montez","course_id":52,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-07-15","end_date":"1852-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In July of 1852, Lola Montez opened a copy of the <em>New York Daily Times</em> and came face to face with column after column of slanderous comments directed at her. Defamation of character is probably one of the most challenging things that one person can go through. People expressing half-truths without actually knowing the real story is a battle most people will face at some point in their lives. In the case of Lola Montez, the <em>New York Times</em> and the Common Council, an elected legislative body of the city of New York, called her a brazen prostitute and said that there are certain crimes that cannot occur without accomplices. They claimed that she proved herself guilty to everyone what her true character was by fleeing and hiding from the public. Finally Lola had enough, and on July 15th she wrote a letter to <em>Times</em> editor H.J Raymond, the gentleman who had allowed the slanderous comments to be printed in the newspaper in the first place."," ","Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert, or Lola as she was more famously known, was born in Limerick Ireland; her dream was to leave Europe for America believing that she would live among generous and justice loving people there. She was an Irish adventuress; she took dance lessons in Spain and proclaimed herself to be Spanish dancer. With her dance training she was able to tour throughout Europe. She was the daughter of an army officer.  When she was a child around eleven years old she had acquired her wild and free eccentric habits. She came to America with the same mentality as most immigrants did, and with the same premonitions as most females during that time period. Her goal was not to do harm to others but to look for a better paying job and escape from poverty. Desperate for money, she turned to prostitution. During this time period, the number of brothels had sky rocketed in New York. Lola was not the only prostitute looking for a chance to escape poverty. Many others such as, Maria Williamson bought and controlled a few brothels making her a substantial amount of money."," ","In her letter to the editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, Lola never depicts herself as a prostitute. Instead, she depicts herself as a Spanish trained dancer, who happened to catch the attention of a very noble king looking for companionship. She met King Louis of Bavaria in 1846 while touring as a dancer in Munich. She soon became his mistress and influenced him greatly in supporting things that she believed in such as liberal and anti-Jesuit policies. She married King Louis in 1847, and her power over him provoked angry reactions and once she realized that she was unsuited for his character, she divorced him in 1848 and fled the country and returned back to the stage, leaving King Louis to abandon his throne. Never once did she ever believe that her name would be used in vain and used for so many cruel and unjust things."," ","History shows that in the nineteenth century New York City was a thriving location for unscrupulous landlords, consumers and prostitutes. Unregulated and unsupervised, the red light districts exploded across the city, which eventually lead to twenty and twenty five thousand prostitutes working there by 1869. In fact, between five and ten percent of women in the city were involved in prostitution. With time, prostitution transformed to reflect and cater to consumer demand. During this time period, prostitutes were among the freest, wealthiest and most educated women in the United States. Like Lola Montez, many prostitutes befriended and gained the confidence of men that were looking for outside companionship. While some feminists were seeking to free women from slavery, prostitutes married later in life and divorced more frequently than other American woman. The <em>New York Times</em> stated that the Common Council had been taking lessons from Lola Montez, and said also that she hides herself in shame. They claimed that she took advantage of public charity as well. Lola challenged these accusations and called on her accusers to specify and prove her alleged offences."," ","In the final part of her retaliation against the editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, she requests that he admit his ignorance and state that he wrongly accused her of immoral activities. Otherwise she would be seeking legal action and let the courts decide who was actually being unjust, even though that was a road she did not really want to walk down. She was defenseless at that point; no one would take her seriously in order to prove that she was nothing more than a dancer and a companion to men. The letter makes it clear that Lola was tired of people belittling her without giving her a chance to clear her name.   She appealed to the editor to write another article in which he admitted that his cruel words were nothing more than pure ignorance, however no such letter had ever appeared in the column of <em>Times</em>."],"display_date":"July 15, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-15","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":859,"tag":"Nineteenth Century"},{"id":83,"tag":"Prostitution"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5154,"title":"The Changing Public Attitude towards Slavery","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-03-10","end_date":"1841-03-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the changes in the public mindset towards slavery had not yet been fully reinforced by law but the distaste with which other countries had viewed the institution for some time was clear.  Blatant racism was still plainly evident, yet the abolition movement was now growing and the public response to prejudice was now becoming very different.  After recent written accounts of slavery in the United States had been published by intellectuals such as Harriet Martineau and James Silk Buckingham, there were others from overseas taking on the voyage to the United States.  They wished to reveal and record what they saw about this young, powerful republic with such controversial politics at hand, in wonderment of the idealized American principles burdened so heavily by slavery’s contradiction of them, and to participate in the abolishment of the institution.","On March 10, 1841, one such voyage carrying many passengers of international backgrounds from Great Britain to America.  Joseph Sturge, an author and anti-slavery movement member, recalls how an inebriated British man, in calling to attention a waiter standing by, referred to him as “blackey”.  The waiter responded, “My name is Robert; when you want anything from me, please address me by my name; there is no gentleman on board who would have addressed me as you have done; we are all of the same flesh and blood; I did not make myself; God made me”.","His intoxication was of no excuse, and while many passengers on board indeed held their own opinions as to the lesser status of black men, it was also understood by the observers that there was not a man present, no matter their prejudices, who would have supported the initial offender against this much-deserved return. Sturge’s observations reflect that the passengers on the voyage to America could see the waiter as a man, much as themselves, and could not deny the accuracy of his response.  In decades earlier, few black men standing alone would have dared speak out without fear of immediate and unanimous reprisal, yet this was 1841, and here was a glimpse of the gradual but necessary progressions of the public outlook about slavery as an unacceptable institution.","Abolition-movement members such as the American brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan were working diligently towards their cause, an attempt to “ma[ke] the whole nation look the captives in the face”, as yet another overseas onlooker noted.   People were becoming uncomfortable with slavery and racism as it seemed uncivilized and sinful amongst developed men.  Author St. George Tucker noted how even in pursuit of  independence and the hope for a better life which the Americans had sought for themselves, somehow they had turned from the oppressed into the oppressors, and in many cases, much more viciously.","The traveling writers from overseas were being joined by many American intellectuals, such as Emerson and Thoreau amongst others, all pointed in their goal of revealing a changing attitude about slavery in the United States.  Developments in communication allowed this perspective to circulate more widely than ever possible before.  Many people now not only understood the institution of slavery but were faced with its details every day.  The cultivation of thought encouraged by publications seemed to require a new evolution in behavior."],"display_date":"March 10, 1841","search_date":"1841-03-10","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5159,"title":"America Experiments with Medicine","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/00","end_date":"12/31/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["With the idea that America was the new Promised Land, many Americans were open  to everything new including ideas on health.  Diet, nutrition and wellness were topics of debate, often with men claiming to have the latest and greatest cure-all remedy.","Reverend Sylvester Graham was an advocate for healthful living.  He introduced a restrictive diet excluding meat, butter, coffee, tea and any intoxicating drinks.  He felt that these impurities would cause sexual desire and lead to disease.  Graham was also a strong advocate for maintaining a moral lifestyle that included exercise, proper attire, good sleeping habits and continence.  He had many followers, some of whom would call him Dr. Graham despite the fact he was not formally educated as one.  Upon a visit to an orphan asylum, James Silk Buckingham found they applied Graham’s diet to the children by feeding them a strictly vegetarian diet.  The orphanage claimed this helped the children build better bodies than that of meat eaters and protected them from diseases.  Graham's radical views often provoked opposition from the meat industry as well as husbands who did not want intercourse limited with their wives.","Although there were some educated doctors who followed more conservative practices, the majority had little education and was of lower class.   Of these doctors, there were some who would make radical health claims for cures.   A Chinaman noted in his writings of American doctors that many of them would make absurd claims for remedies and dismisses the Chinese medicine practiced for thousands of years stating it was outdated.  He commented, “Indeed, in no other field does ignorance, superstition, credulity, and lack of real education display itself as among the American doctors or healers. I believe I could fill a volume by the mere enumeration of the diabolical and absurd nostrums offered by knaves to heal men who profess to hold in ridicule the Chinese doctors”.  Transportation made it possible for these men to seek out vulnerable Americans who were in desperate need of a cure only to take their money and recommend a remedy that had no basis.","According to Doctor Peter Conrad, the educated doctors of the times pressed to have legal regulation among health care practitioners and felt the current treatments were unreliable and often dangerous.  However, many people challenged this as they felt some of the treatments, especially from educated holistic practitioners, were valuable and often superior to that of the formally educated doctors.  Dr. Conrad states “belief held that the practice of medicine should be ‘democratic’ and open to all, or at least all men.”   Self-help was still a common practice among them.","The Americans viewed themselves superior to that of other countries and felt their newly discovered remedies were more advanced.  It seems this naive and narrow-minded approach dismissed remedies of their ancestors and left them with trial, error, luck and a false sense of elitism."," "],"display_date":1900,"search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":49747,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":883,"tag":"diet"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":888,"tag":"Graham"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5169,"title":"Lower Working Class Life of New York City","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the 19<sup>th</sup> century New York City was a populous municipality, with over 220,000 inhabitants by the 1830s. It was diverse, consisting of both prosperous and impoverished areas. Many buildings were beautifully created with an artistic impression, while others were insignificant and deplorable.  Prince Maximilian of Wied’s chronicled his travels in New York during this time and described the contrast between its beauty and unattractiveness. This proved the strong gap that existed between the wealthy and poor, with both groups calling the city their home. Additionally, it was easily accessible to travelers because of its convenient location on the ocean’s edge. With all its activity and work, in a boisterous setting, immigrants from several areas of the globe, especially Europe, congregated in New York City. Recent immigrants as well as second and third generation natives made up the city’s lower working class. The people adjusted to American urban life, inhabited residences, and took up whatever jobs were available throughout the city.  These circumstances enabled a prevalent, dynamic, and industrious commerce.","With the perception of the American dream in mind, people’s natural ambition was to get money, become successful, and reach happiness in life. What better place to aspire for and live out this dream than New York City?  Immigrants exhibited the strong desire to obtain a good job that paid well and expectations of achieving the American dream. The jobs attainable by the lower working class consisted of industrial and factory work. These were tedious roles that demanded back breaking work and paid minimal wages. Additional occupations like maids and seamstresses were also typical for the lower working class of New York City. The hours entailed in these jobs were long and once again pay was minimal, yet the labor required was arduous and physically demanding. Seamstresses were paid only by the pieces of their work, as opposed to an hourly rate, and this was oftentimes unpredictable. Other jobs for the lower working class included lamplighters, chimney sweepers, and couriers.","Residential circumstances were not always optimum for the lower working class. Greed driven landlords found it unprofitable to rent to that specific type of family. However, there were some landlords that did rent out to working class families. Their property consisted of two-room apartments located in brick buildings, known as tenements. One apartment would get rented out to two separate families, resulting in communal living.  Unfortunately many of them were left to rent in wooden buildings. These variations were typically neglected, rundown and dilapidated because the landlords felt it was inconsequential to repair or replace anything. Their main purpose was to gain as much profit as possible by cramming families into living quarters, and the families had no choice. New York had a shortage of tenements, and it was imperative for the inhabitants to reside within walking distance to their job locations.","Public hygiene conditions were far from sanitary, and with the combination of families residing in cramped living situations, the repercussions were repugnant. Since plumbing had yet to reach the tenements, human waste was kept in large containers, just below outhouses. When the containers would become backed up or storm flooding would occur, human waste would wash into the streets among the other debris and, occasionally, seep into homes. This brought forth exposure to many infectious diseases. This was particularly dire because the medical field was still developing. They were still researching what caused epidemics, while recognizing newer ones brought from overseas.  People were unaware how to prevent and treat these diseases. Consequently, several illnesses ran rampant through the population, including cholera. The proliferation of the population, inadequate transportation and cramped and unsanitary living conditions made lving in the city for the lower working class almost unbearable."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":896,"tag":"Labor"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5227,"title":"The Irish Riot on Saint Patrick’s Day","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-17","end_date":"1867-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Four leaf clovers adorned the street corners of New York City, soft bagpipes in the background-accompanied fiddles, and the whiskey flowed forth with a seemingly endless supply.

That was until Captain Frank O’Brien, Birmingham, Alabama’s fourteenth mayor, leased the upper floor of a small brick building in the city’s Southside in 1872. It was named Sublett’s Hall in honor of a Confederate Major from Mississippi and was the first theatre in Birmingham. Captain O’Brien is best remembered for his other contribution to the city: O’Brien’s Opera House. Like Sublett’s Hall, O’Brien’s Opera House opened in the upper floors of a brick building. However, the Opera House was built ten years later in the city’s Northside. The theatre’s opening night was a sell-out. On that night, the theatre showed <em>The Black Cook. </em>The Parisian musical had been controversial when it played in New York. Sermons were even preached against it. Opening night was eventful for another reason. The lights would not turn on. Captain O’Brien borrowed headlights from locomotives from the nearby train yard.","In 1899, a New York company, Klaw and Erlanger, leased the theatre for five years for $4000.

O’Brien’s Opera House attracted large crowds from all parts of the young city until 1900 when the larger and more beautiful Jefferson Theatre opened a few blocks away. The Opera House would reopen in 1906 under different ownership as The Gaiety, a burlesque house. The Gaiety closed in 1912 and was demolished in 1915, but theatre was just beginning to flourish in Birmingham.","According to Don Haarbauer, theatre in Birmingham is unique in the South because the city was founded after the Civil War and therefore has few ties to the society of the “Old South.” The city never had an aristocracy devoted to the arts.

The crush of pedestrian traffic that gathered on the bridge's promenade deck was anxious to experience what was described as the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", and no doubt contained shoppers. In the lower left-hand corner of the cover page of this booklet, the figure of a young woman draped in Romanesque robes stands on a pedestal inscribed with the words \"Excelsior\" (meaning <em>ever higher</em>). The commemorative laurel wreath she holds in her left hand is pointed toward the bridge while her right hand holds an unfurled American flag with staff. The young woman appears to cast her gaze out over the harbor where a view of the bridge's expanse can clearly be seen. Engineering genius, workmanship, and size are suggested by the artists' renditions on the front cover of the souvenir booklet and in the fifteen sketches contained inside the official book and program chronicling the <em>Opening Ceremonies of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge</em>. On its cover page are portrait insets of both John A. Roebling (1806-1869), the original engineer (upper left-hand corner) and his son, Washington (1837-1926), the current Chief Engineer for the project (lower right-hand corner). The front-cover acknowledgement of their role in the achievement is heralded by a cherub that playfully frolics between their portraiture in the shadow of the bridge's massive span.","While the booklet and book/ program were produced to commemorate the bridge's official opening, cumulatively these artists' renditions appropriately exalt American know-how, excellence, and spirit of determination in the dawning decades of the Second Industrial Revolution. The economic promise of this 17-year engineering marvel was touted by a litany of regional political and religious dignitaries as throngs of promenade onlookers followed the 41 pages of proceedings and drawings. However, the general public deferred their judgment and celebration. Quite possibly, because thousands watched the fireworks after the proceedings that day from within less than a mile of the multimillion-dollar bridge. They watched from decaying slums where New York's immigrants lived in abject poverty. When viewed from the center promenade area of the bridge, the slums may have taken on the ambience of the peaceful horizon; however, one would beg a closer look.","Under the bridge expanse, a busy harbor gorged with sailing vessels can be seen. Many, no doubt, are on their way to New York City's busy piers and waiting stevedores, their cargo holds brimming with building supplies, produce, dry goods, and other merchandise. Soon, efficient access to the bridge would accommodate their cargo via its freight rails ? fueling consumerism. The advent of increased commerce would add momentum to the rate of growth of merchandising and other business activities in New York and across the nation.

The official book/program provides insight into the pomp and circumstance of the event, which was heralded by a full complement of fireworks, music, and speeches. A popular pastime from opening day, a stroll on the promenade deck of the bridge was such an attraction that one week after its opening, confusion within an exceptionally large crowd ended with the deaths of twelve people. After a formal inquiry, modifications were made expediently to the narrow stairwells leading to the promenade entrances and egress.

To do so, they needed to relocate to areas that were less populated than the North. Despite their admiration for South Carolina’s “lands and climate,” northerners feared living in the state, because of the potential violence. During this time, South Carolina began enacting black codes to restrict the freedoms and movements of freedmen. Northerners believed it to be only a matter of time until blacks started protesting the laws. While other states in the South enacted similar codes, these northerners thought South Carolina’s to be the harshest. Because of this, they chose to settle in the northwest rather than the South.","White residents of South Carolina did not believe the state had a lack of migrants due to the black codes. Instead, they expressed the opinion that white northerners were apprehensive to live among such a large number of free blacks. A writer for the <em>Nashville Press </em>article vehemently denounced this claim. “It is not true white immigrants will not go where there are negro laborers, or where there is negro competition. The sole condition of immigration is embraced in the word security.”","For these settlers, the number one concern was safety. They believed that as long as the codes were in effect, security could never exist in the state. Settlers, or emigrants, were not the ones negatively affected by the codes. They found suitable land for their intended purposes in other parts of the country. The people who the codes hurt, the article argued, were the residents of South Carolina. As long as the black codes were in place, immigration would not occur. If the codes were abolished, there would be “unprecedented progress of the South” as a result of new settlement.","South Carolina began passing black codes immediately following the war. The state ratified a constitution in 1865 that forbade blacks from voting. In order to prevent blacks from combating the laws, South Carolina set up racial restrictions for entering office. This way, no black person could enter South Carolina’s legislature and attempt to do away with the codes.","Besides preventing blacks to enter political office, the black codes in South Carolina stopped freedmen from becoming an “artisan, mechanic, or shopkeeper” without the proper license from a judge. This license cost more than $100, making it unlikely a free black could afford one. Perhaps the most restrictive of all parts of the codes, was the section that limited black migration to the state. If a black person moved to South Carolina, he or she was required within twenty days to enter into a contract and bond to a white master."],"display_date":"December 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-08","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"},{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":366,"tag":"Migration"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":477,"tag":"Black Codes"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5364,"title":"State of Liberty and Immigrants: First Days","course_id":76,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-01-01","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Statue of Liberty is an icon of today, just as it was for immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th Century.  The inauguration of the Statue of LIberty took place on Thursday, October 23, 1886.  The day started with a military, naval and civil parade in New York City.  After the parade, a signal was given for steamers in the bay to move in a particular and pre-calculated order towards the island.  There were certain ceremonies that took place at the base of the statue, which concluded around sunset that day.  To conclude the day's festivities, there was a national salute from all batteries, both on and offshore.  Finally, the statue was illuminated, for all of the citizens to see."," ","The Statue of Liberty would be the first thing an immigrant sees when approaching the American coast.  The immigrants would arrive on ships, which needed to be checked by health officers before being allowed further into the bay.  The immigrants were then moved to a barge for further examinations by United States authorities.  These immigrants were divided into groups of 30.  Each group was tagged or numbered, to distinguish the different groups.  These groups moved onto examination rooms, where each immigrant would be checked for diseases and physical defects.  Those immigrants who were found to have diseases or physical defects were detained.  Examiners had lists, which were organized by groups, where each group told their name and how much money they had, in addition to whatever else the examiner wanted to know.  The immigrants without funds, friends or prospective homes were deemed \"undesirable\" and were marked as such."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1170,"tag":"Statue of Liberty"},{"id":759,"tag":"Immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"ENGL 305: Literary History and Writing","school":"St. Norbert College","course_id":76,"school_id":44}},{"id":5368,"title":"American Women’s Social Status in 1800’s","course_id":80,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-01-01","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Emily Faithfull, an English women right’s activist and writer, discovered an interesting phenomenon during her trips to the United States in 1872 and 1882. Many middle class and upper class women she met were leading a harsh life after losing their fathers or husbands. In two cases, the daughter of a navy Commander and the wife of a General of the United States Army were not able to make a living after the death of their father and husband, respectively. These two cases were only the tip of the iceberg: many upper and middle class women also suffered when their kinsmen dead, lost the ability to work or became unemployed. Even though most of them were willing to take up jobs to improve their living conditions; unfortunately, they did not have the ability to do so. Faithfull discovered that this was due to the “short-sighted policy” in many American families that females did not need to work as they would be married have no necessity to do so (Faithfull, p.281, 282). This illustrated that in the early history of the United States, women were mostly being nurtured in a “green house” and being considered as dependents of the male family members.","The above story reflected the passive role of women in early American society. At that time, women were expected to stay home and take care of the family and housework instead of taking up jobs. According to Faithfull, in 1836 there were only seven occupations opened to women. Although some women had a chance to take up jobs, they had to face low pay. In Vermont, the average salaries of male teachers was 20 dollars a month and 1600 dollars a year. But female teachers only received 8 dollars per month and 750 dollars per year because of tradition and prejudice.

These places of worship were the hub of not only religion, but community, politics, and commerce as well. Palaces like the Notre Dame cathedral served as the heart and soul of the town and its people. In modern times, the center of commerce and congregation has shifted far away from the church and landed on the temples of retail, the department store. Much like the church did in medieval times the department store offers people living in modern villages the chance to gather together, connect, and socialize with people from their community. One of the best examples of this can be seen in the landmark that is Macy’s. Macy’s of New York first opened its doors on October 28, 1858. This iconic New York landmark serves as not only a department store but a tourist attraction as well. Like their famous advertisement says, “If you haven’t seen Macy’s, you haven’t seen New York.”","Historians like Vincent Miller argue that retail is the new religion of the modern age. People go to their local temple and worship the gods that are wealth, status, and luxury. They claim that socioeconomic status has become the new measure of a person in Western society. Some go as far as to say that people have become walking billboards for various brands by sporting logos and trademarks on everything from their shirt to their shoes. Department stores and other various retail outlets have been vilified for everything from sales practices to profit margins.","In his book, <em>The Practice of Everyday, Life</em> the French author Michel de Certeau poses a very different argument. He suggests that the “ordinary man” is the one who is in control. Certeau uses the poetic example of maps and walking down a city street. A city, like New York, finds its heartbeat in its inhabitants. While walking down the street all of the sights, sounds, and smells you encounter are completely subjective. This is also true for a walk through a department store like Macy’s. He goes on to say that maps exist as a way for people to pin down a cityscape, a feat that can never really be accomplished because it is composed of the people who are ever changing. Certeau argues that executives, leaders, and even academics are disconnected from the city by their offices that are high above the rest of the world. Therefore, they are virtually powerless over the public who use various tactics like alteration and mobility to process the world around them in a unique and unknowable way.","In either case, Macy’s has managed to become and remain an iconic American institution for over 150 years.

Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade as well as the Christmas shopping rush have become just as ingrained in American culture as the store itself. A famous article appeared in the December 1948 edition of <em>Life</em> that offered a glimpse into the world of Macy’s. This article details the massive shopping frenzy that occurs between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. An average of 250,000 shoppers flooded the store every day looking for everything form pearls and fur to imported foods and wine. A team of 14,000 employees worked feverishly from opening to close selling roughly one million dollars worth of merchandise per day.

In May 1849, in his small New York cottage, he wrote what was to be his last completed poem, “Annabel Lee,” in which he returned to the themes that had haunted him for much of his life. The poem, set long ago in a kingdom by the sea, describes the speaker’s undying love for the beautiful Annabel Lee. Despite their youth, they share a “love that was more than love,” a love so powerful that envious angels send an unnamed illness to shatter their happiness. Though she dies, his love for her endures, and even years after her death “the moon never beams without bringing me dreams / Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.” He is drawn each night to her \"sepulchre...by the sea,\" where he lies down to sleep beside her lifeless body. Having lived only for her, his life without her is bereft of purpose. Now, he yearns only for death, to return forever to the happiness they shared so briefly in this world.","The rhythm of repeated words and phrases creates a haunting, mournful melody that mirrors the speaker’s mood. Even the poem’s meter, scholars argue, was structured to echo the very ebb and flow of the sea to which the speaker is drawn. Again and again, in “Annabel Lee,” “The Raven,” “Lenore,” and “To Helen,” Poe returned to what he called “the most poetic topic in the world—” the death of a beautiful woman. Indeed, love and death drove much of Poe’s writing, reflecting a life defined by tragedy. Abandoned by his father, orphaned as an infant, he found happiness in his marriage to his young cousin Virginia—only to watch her slowly waste away from tuberculosis. “Annabel Lee,” written two years after her death, was Poe's attempt to give words to the love and sorrow that still consumed him.","This obsession with death typified Victorian culture, which responded to the disease-defined realities of the nineteenth century by blending Christian and classical understandings of death. They infused death with beauty and redemptive power, transforming it into a work of art capable of giving meaning to one’s entire life. A “good death” was one in which the individual embraced their own mortality with hope and acceptance. Death was spiritualized as focus shifted from the dying, decaying body toward the soul. Their vision of heaven was of a physical, material place, a place of natural and artistic beauty where they would be reunited with those they love. Heaven was, as Mark Schantz argues, “a tabula rosa upon which Americans could inscribe their most profound hopes and aspirations.”","Americans blurred the boundary between heaven and earth, as if a breath of poetry—as if the power and passion of one’s love—was enough to reach those they had lost. In “Annabel Lee,” Poe describes such a love—a love that literally triumphs over the forces of heaven and earth, a love that haunts the living and that transcends death itself.

On August 29, 1866, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> reported that cholera deaths in New York were at a standstill, and reports extensively from an article from <em>The New York World</em> that “not a single case occurred in the hotel,” and business on the streets and cleaner parts was “free from disease.” Transmission and prevention measures were also being taken to ensure that disease rates were controlled, which was quite the opposite for Chicagoans. There were reports that cholera in Chicago was caused by fall trade, lack of precautionary measures, not having a grasp on the sanitary aspect of the disease. Reports continued to bash the residents of these Western cities (Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Memphis), claiming that it was “their fault” for not taking precaution even after being warned about the preventive measures of the disease and its deadliness. Aside from only a “few dozen” cholera deaths, however, the overall health and cleanliness of New York was excellent.","About 12 years prior to the 1866 cholera epidemic, John Snow found that cholera was a direct effect of the lack of sanitation within the city. The broad street pump in London was contaminated with feces and led to the cholera epidemic that ravaged the city. Snow discovered this after removing the handle on the pump, which prevented further use of it. After doing this, there was a sharp decline in and then no more cholera deaths at that time. With this information during the epidemic of cholera in New York and Chicago, both cities were aware of the cause. However, blame was placed on the immigrant population or a person’s predisposition for the disease, possibly in an effort to reduce fear, sustain commerce, and encourage tourism.","The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> further reports, however, that the cholera epidemic was actually quite different in Chicago than the New Yorkers made it seem. The city of Chicago was in reality, ahead of New York City in terms of municipal cleanliness and overall health of the area. Unlike New York, Chicago did not have “those cellars two stories below which breed pestilence” nor “those crowded courts and miserable masses of tenement houses,” which is where cholera often thrived. Due to apparent overcrowding in New York, cleaning the city and escaping the fate of cholera was actually impossible for them. Reporters claimed that New Yorkers knew this to be true, and slandered Chicago in an effort to maintain business and get rid of the guilt they had from misrepresenting their disease data. Furthermore, Chicago’s grasp on reporting deaths from cholera seemed to be better in terms of value and accuracy then that of New York, in their effort to provide the most information about the progression of disease in their city. New Yorkers, however, were negligent in this regard because they did not bother to report accurate numbers. If anyone were to travel to New York, they would actually find the death toll from cholera to be extremely high. To make cholera appear less brutal, however, it was sometimes referred to in reports about disease in Chicago as “Cholera-morbus,” which was less rapid and less severe symptomatically, but equally as fatal.","There is no doubt that disease during 1866 epidemic brought about fear and panic, and there is no wonder why those individuals responsible for reporting wanted to make their city seem like they had better concept of disease and more control over the prevention and spread of cholera."],"display_date":1866,"search_date":"1866-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"},{"id":2539,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1322,"tag":"disease in the north"},{"id":827,"tag":"Chicago"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"},{"id":1315,"tag":"cholera"},{"id":1323,"tag":"rivalry"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5484,"title":"Excellent Progress on the New York Subway","course_id":85,"status":"P","start_date":"9/27/02","end_date":"10/28/04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On September 27, 1902 the <em>Scientific American</em> highlighted the development of the first New York City subway. The monthly <em>Scientific American</em> magazine, which focused on scientific discoveries and technological innovations around the world, detailed the progress of the subway through the use of various diagrams and articles.  The New York Subway was well underway during the publication of the article and was scheduled to be completed ahead of its previous publicized date. The newly created transportation network would be utilized to further stimulate the economic, social, and transportation needs of New York City’s residents."," ","Subway systems were integral in the economic development of New York City. The subway system allowed citizens to continue to expand outward from the densely settled area around Manhattan and Brooklyn and thrive by allowing traditionally geographically disadvantaged citizens to travel further from their homes. This allowed many citizens to have a greater sense of freedom and a broader social and economical reach. The availability of new forms of transit allowed these individuals to get to their destinations cheaper and more efficiently without sole reliance on elevated commuter railroads or horse drawn forms of transportation. The construction of the New York Subway facilitated the creation of many new jobs and a consistent supply of work by linking many different businesses with customers that were previously inaccessible and allowing both parties to benefit from its usage."," ","The creation of the New York Subway system was a great engineering achievement in the early 1900s. The <em>Scientific American</em> article stated the project required the excavation of over 1,700,000 cubic yards of earth and the employment of over 65,000 tons of steel in its construction.  One of the biggest concerns with a project of this magnitude was allowing other transportation systems to operate without disruption during construction. Much of the modern infrastructure of New York City was already in place and it was of great concern to leave it undisturbed. It was necessary to relocate gas, water, and electric lines while excavating the tunnels and connecting the underground network. While removing the millions of yards of debris, it was of great importance to maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel. Tunnels were dug using a method known as \"Cut and Cover\". Through this method, one side of the street was excavated to a depth of at least 30 feet, the subway tunnel was constructed, and eventually it was covered upon completion. In contrast to previously constructed shallow subway tunnels, the New York City Subway tunnels were supported in all directions by concrete walls and utilized a network of steel beams and waterproofing. This structural composure added many different benefits to the subway system. In cases when it was necessary to excavate both sides of a street simultaneously, support bridges and trestles were erected to maintain street access for ground transportation. Engineers used these systems to minimize any detrimental effects above the surface while they continued to further expand the New York subway system belowground."," ","Many of the building supplies that were designated to be used in the production of the New York Subway were shared with above-ground transportation systems. The materials used for the subway tracks were adopted from the above-ground trolleys. While the availability of trolley tracks was a benefit, it also facilitated the need to develop new solutions in regards to powering the tracks. Engineers carefully worked to retrofit the trolley tracks and modify the foundation the tracks were laid on to facilitate the delivery of electricity to the subway line."," ","Upon the first day of its completion, over 150,000 eager riders rode the New York subway system according to an article in the<em> New York Times </em>dated October 28, 1904. The first train arrived at One Hundred and Forty-Fifth Street from City Hall Park in exactly twenty six minutes and the reality of rapid transit was realized by many New Yorkers. The articles in <em>Scientific American</em> and <em>The New York Times </em>did an exceptional job stirring public interest for the new transportation system. These articles placed an emphasis on the many attractive features that the New York Subway had to offer and highlighted the many different architectural and engineering achievements. The<em> New York Times </em>article had a broader focus and placed a lesser emphasis on the intricate construction process of the system.    In contrast, The <em>Scientific American</em> article focused primarily on building details and engineering aspects of the project and was intended for readers with a scientific interest in the project."],"display_date":"September 27, 1902 - October 28, 1904","search_date":"1903-10-13","locations":[{"id":49747,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"},{"id":1364,"tag":"Subway"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":85,"school_id":43}},{"id":5630,"title":"A New York Doctor’s Supports Slavery","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As many northerners opposed slavery, some certainly did not. The idea of the abolition of slavery became the central political issue in the North as well as the South during the 1850s. In 1853, Doctor John H. Van Evrie of New York explained, “Gigantic efforts are now being made to convince the people of the North that the overthrow of the present relations of black and white races in the South, or what is mistakingly called ‘the Abolition of Slavery.” Doctor Van Evrie argued against the benefits of the abolition of slavery for whites, blacks, and the whole of the United States civilization. As he clarified, “To overthrow the present relation of the races is to injure both the white man and the Negro, and to inflict a deadly blow upon the cause of humanity, civilization, and Christianity.” Fortunately, his political opinion was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. However, racism remained rampant in the North and especially in the South. Dr. Van Evrie argued that a philanthropic movement, sparked by the Quakers, led to a gradual emancipation of slaves in the northern states. He concluded that, “Several states were induced to follow the example of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.” Gradual emancipation occurred in New Jersey and New York followed by the rest of the northern states. The movement gained significant strength in the latter part of the decade.","Historian Leon F. Litwack explained that, “Fundamental differences existed between a condition of legal servitude and freedom, municipal, state and federal statutes which relegated northern Negroes to a position of legal inferiority.” Northern freedmen were not held captive by slavery; however, they did experience discrimination and certain prejudices which subjected them to poor socio-economic standing. Litwack detailed in his article that, “Northern Negroes found themselves systematically separated from the white community.” Although Van Evrie’s argument may be immoral, he was right that the abolition of slavery would cause problems for the population as a whole.

He gained notoriety worldwide as a brilliant crusader for the liberty of his country, and upon announcing a tour around the United States to enlist support for his cause, Kossuth was met with the enthusiasm of the American media. The <em>New York Times</em> welcomed him and published his “Address to the People of the United States.” In his address he explained Hungary’s “struggle of independence” as not much different from America’s former struggle. Kossuth flattered Americans, suggesting that American liberty inspired the rest of the world: “May your great example, noble Americans, be to other nations the source of social virtue; your power be the terror of all tyrants- the protector of the distressed; and your free country ever continue to be the asylum for the oppressed of all nations.”"," ","Though Kossuth intended his message to be an invitation to help him, different parts of the nation interpreted it in their own way. Kossuth never mentioned slavery in his address. However, his appreciation of the US as a “free country” and his condemnation of “tyrants” caught the attention of abolitionists who hoped to enlist Kossuth in their cause. Abolitionists felt something of kinship with Kossuth as they viewed the oppression of slaves and Hungarians to be similar causes. Abolitionists urged Kossuth to endorse abolition but felt betrayed when he refused to do so. Knowing that such a declaration would cost him support in the most of the country and hoping to raise funds from rich southerners, Kossuth tried to avoid associating with abolitionists. He appealed to Southerners in supporting states' rights but ultimately was unable to advocate for democracy abroad when many leading Southerners would hardly promote democracy at home. His image as a freedom fighter was too much for conservative southern slaveholders to handle, so they rejected Kossuth’s presence and mission during his tour."," ","After a stay of about a year in the US, Kossuth failed to raise adequate support and funds for his cause. His tour of the US revealed how avoiding slavery politics was impossible during a time when the question of slavery consumed the nation. Though his cause was separate from slavery issues, Americans managed to interpret Kossuth through an American lens. Since his mission did not fit exactly into any side of the slavery debate, Americans felt comfortable ignoring Kossuth and focused on their own issues. The strong divisiveness of slavery politics shaped how Americans confronted foreign policy, and Kossuth’s visit proved the US was not ready to confront issues of freedom internationally when freedom was being contested so heatedly on their own soil."],"display_date":"October 20, 1851","search_date":"1851-10-20","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":1218,"tag":"The New York Times"},{"id":1597,"tag":"Louis Kossuth"}],"course":{"name":"Transatlantic Abolitionism","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":96,"school_id":11}},{"id":5764,"title":"Racial Relationships within the Suburban Community","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/73","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The large amount of social change that occurred within the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century arose from the push toward equality between the groups of people urging the nation for integration.  These groups pushed for the basic rights for people of any gender, race, or sexual-orientation.  This desire to change the nation led to many government and social acts to protect and provide these oppressed groups with basic rights that had been stripped from them, but these changes where not over-night successes.  It took years for the effects of these changes to be felt.","One of the most commonly discussed topics that arouse from the civil rights movement is racial equality, arising from the dissatisfaction of the black community after the war.  There was a strong drive to rid the nation of the bigotry and prejudice that constantly followed them everywhere.  Eventually there was a slow process of integration and ever growing opportunity for the African American community, but along with this success, there was the presence of opposition and subtle condescension by some members of the white community.","The movement of more and more black families into the typical suburban “white” neighborhoods, for example, usually caused some form of confrontation in one way or another.  In the county of Westchester, New York, there seemed to have developed a fad that came to be called “Rent-a-Black parties” by the African American community and “Integrated Parties” by the members of the white community.  They usually dealt with the invitation of a black guest by white hostesses, as a form of acceptance into the community.  Many times these party invitations did stem from a friendship and shared interest, but there were those invitations that arose as a subtle form of ridicule.  Eventually these forms of “community acceptance” did go into decline as the peculiarity associated with the “new black family” by the white community became less and less of an issue."],"display_date":"1955 - 1973","search_date":"1964-07-01","locations":[{"id":30037,"lat":40.9100159753,"lng":-73.7674032747,"zoom":9,"place":"Westchester, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1787,"tag":"Suburbs"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":629,"tag":"race"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5771,"title":"<strong>Women's Suffrage Parade in New York</strong>","course_id":115,"status":"P","start_date":"1/2/07","end_date":"1/2/07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women did not have the right to vote in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, nor were they allowed to participate in any form of politics. They were not satisfied with such inequality. A visiting European dignitary -- Paul H.B. d'Estournelles de Constant -- noted the commitment shown by American women to achieve their rights. He noted that people laughed at the woman who claims the right to vote. Therefore, women pushed the boundary in setting up movements that enabled them to get involved in political activities. “The movement in favor of votes for women is a protest of outraged morality against the masculine infringements of politics on private life, conscience and individual liberty” (Estournelles de Constant p.72). \" I have heard the most frivolous society women admire the grandeur of an immense procession that went past their windows in New York. it was a women's demonstration, carried out on a winter day, amid rain and mud. Thousands and thousands of women, of all ages, all classes and all kinds, marched past, without distinction of place, forgetful of the times in which they lived, of their inequalities of station, of their joys and sorrows, their minds fixed upon a common purpose -- the emancipation of their sex and the right to act, compete, protest and vote in public as well as in private.\" (p.68)","Estournelles notes that eventually women finally earned the right to vote, in eleven states initially.

Rob A Poor man of his Beer!\" and the meaning behind the words contained within that were written by \"Mr. John Barleycorn Jr.\". The name of the author appears to be a fictitcious name that was used by the anonymous writer of the pamphlet to personify alcohol and to better get his point across. The article was published for the use of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union.","Organizations such as the Women's National Christian Temperance Union were key players in the fight for national Prohibition of alcohol and utilized documents such as \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" to get their message across to readers. The exact date of the pamphlets publication is not noted in the document, but it was created by the National Temperance Society and Publication House in New York sometime between December 24th 1873 when the first protest by the Temperance group occurred to prior to the January 16th, 1920, adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment which prohibited the sale and distribution of alcohol.","The document is a poem that describes the possible pitfalls of alcohol consumption and attempts to focus on the important negative aspects of the consequences of its use such as the financial strain, domestic violence, and immoral behavior that its abuse promotes. It is obvious that the document is a pro-Prohibition document that was designed to enlighten the reader and was used as a tool by the Christian Temperance Union to gain support for a nationwide ban on alcohol production.","The pamphlet points out how much money is wasted on alcohol consumption that could be used to improve the lives of the families that it affects. It places a great deal of emphasis upon how funds are wasted in the saloons that could be better the economic situations for many families. This was a definite concern during those times.","As stated in the poem \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" there is mention of a few examples of the type of financial issues that alcoholic abuse contributed to. One such example was mentioned in this statement \"Of ten thousand dollars paid upon the spot, two-thirds was paid directly to the saloons.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This statement alone proves that alcoholism was a major cause for economic problems that were hurting the economy of families across the nation. Violence is also hinted towards in the pamphlet.","There are several lines in the poem which point out alcohol as being the reason for violence in the family. One such line states \"What! Rob a Poor man of his ale, and prevent him from beating his wife.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This one line speaks of how violence in the family directed towards women was a serious issue and a justification for Prohibition to be ratified. It is clear from such statements that the author wanted to alert readers that domestic abuse occurred when intoxicated husbands returned home from a night out at the saloon.","Overall the document is a perfect example of how organizations got their message across in regard to their views on Prohibition during an era when print media was the only way to spread information and influence public opinion. The pamphlet's author utilized a poem to explain the downfalls of alcoholism and more importantly promoted and drew attention to the benefits of a dry nation. It was also a way to deliver a message to the general population in a language that everyone could understand at that time. This is clear in the simplistic, informative, but also somewhat entertaining, way that the author attempts to get the attention of the reader by his or her use of a poetic form of writing."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 24, 1873","search_date":"1873-12-24","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1840,"tag":"Womens Temperance"},{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5792,"title":"<strong>A Poet Describes the Horrors of a Civil War Hospital</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-12-01","end_date":"1892-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In his poem <em>A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown</em>, Walt Whitman described one of the most haunting memories of his medical career: “Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all, / Faces [<em>sic</em>], varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, / some of them dead, / Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, / the odor of blood, / The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd.” The setting of Whitman’s nightmare was an impromptu field hospital likely located somewhere near a battlefield. Whitman’s poem poignantly explained the horrors that one could find at field hospitals during the Civil War: “Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made, Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps, And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke, By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down.”","The field hospitals were a horrifying sight for Whitman. This is surprising, in many ways, since Whitman served as a nurse during the Civil War.  For Whitman, the field hospitals lacked sufficient space for all the wounded soldiers in their care.  They reeked of blood and other odors. Not to mention, they presented endless labor for the surgeons and their assistants, who did everything in their power to end the suffering of the wounded and dying soldiers. What Whitman saw in the field hospital haunted his memories the rest of his life.","Nightmares, like the one experienced by Whitman, were common at field hospital during the Civil War. Because field hospitals were the quickest and most efficient source of medical care throughout the years of the war, they existed at essentially every battlefield. In a piece concerning the topic of medical care during the Civil War, historian Victoria Holder wrote that at the beginning of the war, neither the Union nor the Confederacy had any plan for hospitals because they did not believe fighting would last more than a couple months. By 1862, the Union and Confederacy had passed laws creating hospital systems, but by that time, field hospitals were the most relied upon source of treatment for wounded soldiers. Field hospitals were often located a mile or two away from the battlefield. They frequently lacked ample room and supplies to treat the men in their care.","Historian James McPherson, when he wrote about medicine in the Civil War, stated that field hospitals were often churches, hotels, warehouses, shops, barns, private homes, etc. In terms of staff, they were often composed of white women who volunteered to help out. From these sources alone, it is not farfetched to believe what Whitman described in his poem was the truth."],"display_date":"December 1867 - January 1892","search_date":"1879-12-31","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1839,"tag":"Walt Whitman"},{"id":1838,"tag":"Field Hospital"},{"id":1837,"tag":"Poem"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5793,"title":"<strong><em>Harper's Weekly</em> Demands the US Disarm the Ku Klux Klan</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-03-25","end_date":"1871-03-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a news brief on March 25, 1871, <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> declared, “It is agreed upon all sides that the condition of the late rebel States is deplorable.” This magazine did not mention, however, that the reason the conditions of the rebel States was deplorable was because of the presence of the Ku Klux Klan. In response to the violent acts that the Ku Klux Klan had committed, a special committee of Congress had been called together. The committed responded that “…the remedy seems to be simple. Removal of every pretense of complaint, and complete personal security, are now required. General enfranchisement, and the summary destruction of the Ku-Klux, should be simultaneous.”","For the committee, the disablement of the Ku Klux Klan was a necessity. <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> noted on the matter, “Plainly, if disabilities are removed, the Ku-Klux may come into possession of the State governments.” The threat of the Ku Klux Klan gaining political power frightened the special committee. The Klan was a threat that required the US to intervene and stop. This was reflected strongly in the news brief’s ending: “The Ku-Klux terrorism indefinitely postpones the tranquility which is indispensable to the Southern States.” Thus, only with the Ku Klux Klan out of the picture could the southern States peacefully be assimilated back into the Union.","This news brief from <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> accurately reflects the fears of many people in the South during the years of reconstruction. The<em> Encyclopedia of American Religious History</em> contended that the KKK was originally a social fraternity. This changed, however, once Confederate veterans, under the guidance of Nathan Bedford Forest, took control of the Klan. Furthermore, historian Eric Foner argued that the KKK was a military arm of the Democratic Party in the South. In addition to Confederate Veterans, planters, merchants, and members of the Democratic Party also joined the Klan. the Klan became involved with political terrorism aimed at preventing Republicans from gaining political clout within the former rebel States. The Klan’s regular victims consisted of white Republicans, teachers, blacks, and those promoting Reconstruction.","As mentioned in the news brief, many people demanded the US government dismantle the threat of the KKK. In response to these demands, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act (a.k.a the Third Enforcement Act) on April 20, 1871. This act enabled President Grant to use military force or suspend the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> in order to stop any display of “insurrection” in the former Confederate states. While the Ku Klux Klan Act had moderate levels of success, in the 1876 Supreme Court case of <em>US </em>vs. <em>Cruikshank</em>, the Court’s holding was that the Ku Klux Klan Act was only applicable to state and local governments. Since the KKK was not part of the government, the organization was out of the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Thus, the KKK would survive and continue to haunt the South many decades following the end of Reconstruction."],"display_date":"March 25, 1871","search_date":"1871-03-25","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":151,"tag":"Ku Klux Klan"},{"id":680,"tag":"Harper's Weekly"},{"id":470,"tag":"Reconstruction Period"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5796,"title":"<em><strong>The New York Times</strong></em><strong> Commemorates Jefferson Davis' Death</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-12","end_date":"1889-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article describing the funeral of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, <em>The New York Times </em>wrote, “it [the funeral] was one of such magnificence and taste that the recollection of it will never vanish from the mind of any beholder.” People from all over the South attended Davis’ funeral, which was held in New Orleans on December 11, 1889. Describing the procession, <em>The New York Times</em> noted, “The cortege was more than three miles long, and contained many thousand persons.","Due to the influx of people in attendance, the city of New Orleans delayed the ceremonies for Davis’ funeral from 11 AM to 12 PM. Around 3 PM, Davis’ casket and the rest of the funeral procession arrived at the gates of Metairie Cemetery. Once the procession had reached Davis’ temporary tomb, <em>The New York Times</em> observed the following: “the military formed in double lines around the mound at parade rest, the veterans grouped themselves inside this line, and outside of the glittering line of blue and gold soldiery were tens of thousands of the foremost people of New Orleans.” Once the ceremonies were over, a single-file line was formed in order that people could get one last look at the first and only president of the Confederate States of America.","Undoubtedly, Davis’ political career was the reason that so many people attended his funeral. Even before his time as president of the Confederate States, however, Davis had an impressive career in politics. He was a West Point graduate, a US Senator, a US Representative, and served as secretary of war. At one point in time he was even married to President Taylor’s daughter! During Davis’ time in Congress, he resigned from the US Senate in 1861 to show his support of Mississippi’s quest for secession. The act, along with his already stellar reputation, earned Davis notable fame in the newly seceded southern States. This eventually led to his election as the only president of the Confederate States on February 9, 1861.","Many historians have questioned the value of Davis’ leadership for the South during the Civil War. Historian Eric Foner argued that Davis lacked the ability to effectively manage the South’s economy and deal with obstructionist governors. Davis also lacked skill in diplomacy, which greatly hurt the South.","Despite his lack of skills, throughout the Civil War, and even in its final days, Davis never submitted to Lincoln and the North. Upon the fall of Richmond at the Civil War’s end, Davis was arrested by Federal troops and held in prison for two years. Though he was eventually released, Davis was never pardoned for his acts concerning the Civil War, nor did he ever apologize for any of them. Davis endured a lot of criticism for the defeat of the South throughout the rest of his life, but as seen by this article, people lauded his unwavering devotion to the South.

On September 2,1886 Henry George stood aside John McMackin, Chairman of the Convention of Organized Labor in New York City, and accepted the candidacy for mayor. He begins his speech by formally accepting the nomination, but quickly takes a sobering tone when he warns the audience not to “imagine that the politicians who have made a business of politics for years and have grown fat upon it will allow the working-men to smash their machines without trying their utmost to prevent it.” Various union factions constituted the majority of George’s voting base, but were also joined by Irving Hall Democrats whose anti-Tammany Hall sentiment was strong enough to break them from their traditional voting trends. Similarly, many Republicans were disenchanted by Theodore Roosevelt’s description of labor as “crude, vicious, and un-American,” leading them move to George's third party.","Despite the multitude of support George had accrued from across the political spectrum, George’s self description as a public servant of the working class was a guise, behind which laid ulterior motives; mainly the self-serving purpose of the using the candidacy to propagate his own theories. After all, George had been close acquaintances with both Terence Powderly, and Samuel Gompers the two most influential labor leaders of his day, but stood in constant defiance of the principles they promulgated.","Although he topped Republican Theodore Roosevelt in the polls, the election saw George receive fewer votes than Democrat Abram Hewitt. In an era when the voting base of the working class was numerically superior, what kept the vote of labor from victory? While many workingmen might cite political corruption, and indeed George did, historians often point to factionalization within the already disjointed labor movement. Was this why George was unable to bridge the gaps between men whose best interests were clearly aligned?","While George was a dear friend to both Gompers, and Powderly, they clashed on many of the major issues within the labor movement. Powderly’s Knights of Labor held membership of around 68,000 in New York, enough to effectively direct the outcome of the election. However, George openly disagreed with the Knight’s policy of trade tariffs, and the theory of protectionism. George openly criticized the fallacies of protective tariffs having seen by his own eyes that they did more harm than good. Powderly attempted to avoid what he recognized was a divisive issue that would only further split solidarity among the labor movement, but George was outspoken, and unwilling to censor his beliefs during his campaign.","Gompers too had problems with George’s qualifications to lead the labor party. Leaders such as Gompers believed that intellectuals were not to be trusted. Their sense of ‘right’ was self-serving, and any good intentions they may have had were quickly swept away by their tendency towards individualism. Furthermore, Gompers saw trade unionism as an end-all be-all for the plight of the laborer. And while George did care a great deal for the power of unions, and the working class, it would be mistaken to assume that George believed in the efforts of the labor party as a panacea to industrial sickness he observed.","Unlike his union compatriots George insisted that his effort was not against capital, but in alliance with capital against the landlord. Unlike many of the workingmen, George was strictly anti-socialist, having fervent belief in the power of self-help that “affirms the dignity of the individual to prosper, or suffer as he sees fit.” The idea that capitalism was not to blame was shocking to many unionists, whose ideals focused on the abuse of capital. It was statements such as these that lead historian Frank Genovese to believe that ideological discrepancies proved the greatest barrier to unity. In his speech George addresses what he believes to be the true systematic discrepancies that left such unfavorable outcomes for workingmen. He notes that in New York “enormous value, that the growth of population adds to the land of this city is taken by the few individuals for the benefit of the idle rich, who look down upon those who earn their living by their labor.” In line with his most noted contribution to Political Economy George proposes “tax on land exclusive of improvements, so that a man who is holding land vacant will have to pay as much for it as if he was using it.” This method attempts to discourage land speculation, a dangerous practice that in George’s eyes cause misuse, and by consequence grave inequities. So while he clearly cared a great deal about the predicament of the working class he never truly believed that trade unionism served any greater purpose. This misalignment of interests and theories proved to be most divisive in the election of 1886.","In the end, the election of 1886 served as a sad display of how self-interest lost the day for labor. After his victory Hewitt noted; “they could not allow a man like Henry George to be major of New York. It would upset all the arrangements.”"],"display_date":"October 1886","search_date":"1886-10-16","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2184,"tag":"Single tax"},{"id":2186,"tag":"Election of 1886"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6380,"title":"Escape to Freedom","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sometime in the year 1840, William Green decided that he had enough of being a slave. “White people seem to act as if God made us to be their servants and it is not right for them to keep us in slavery,” he wrote. “I decided I spent enough time in slavery as I was willing to,” he wrote.

With that, William became a fugitive slave and ran and hid and hid and ran. ","Slaves were used to harsh treatment from their masters. They were often whipped and made to do very hard work. Slaves were treated like animals and were bought and sold at auctions like commodities. Slaves were whipped if they were overweight or did not grow fast enough (Johnson, 46-78). Slaves like William and others were whipped for leaving the grounds to visit family members. They suffered with the separation of family and loved ones. Slaves lived in fear of being sold all of the time (Johnson, 5-19). Young William was visiting his father on a nearby plantation and when he returned his days as a slave would soon end. ","Many slaves, like William, lived in fear and in terror all of the time. With the passage of The Fugitive Slave Act, many slaves that escaped were returned to their masters. Many returned to even harsher treatment upon their return (Hartman, 19-20). Other slaves that did not escape lived with the fear of being sold and that their immediate family would be broken up. The fear of disappointment and the terror of the lash was a daily feeling (Hartman, 18). William, his father and his brothers all worked on different plantations. When William ran he knew that he could be caught and returned to Dr. Jenkins. William ran anyway and feared the prospect of getting caught but always hoping that his eventual freedom would happen. William happened to be one of the lucky ones. With the help of his cousins, uncles and other slaves, William managed to escape through Philadelphia then to New York as a fugitive slave. William was tracked by authorities but had help in avoiding capture. People like Dr. Osgood and Dr. Riggles helped him avoid capture (Green, 23).","William Green was one of the fortunate slaves who ran and even got to enjoy his life as a free man. Others were not so lucky. William made his way to Hartford, Connecticut and then settled at Springfield, Massachusetts. There he married and had four children and lived a life of freedom and happiness. "],"display_date":"1840 - 1853","search_date":"1846-12-31","locations":[{"id":52769,"lat":39.0457549,"lng":-76.6412712,"zoom":8,"place":"Maryland"},{"id":52770,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia"},{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"},{"id":52772,"lat":42.315222,"lng":-72.5014715,"zoom":8,"place":"Hartford"},{"id":52773,"lat":42.1014831,"lng":-72.589811,"zoom":8,"place":"Springfield"}],"tags":[{"id":126,"tag":"fugitive slave"},{"id":2734,"tag":"William Green"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6421,"title":"The Civil War: Remembering the Dead","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-05-30","end_date":"1872-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The graves of all of the soldiers in the different cemeteries were strewn with flowers in Brooklyn.

In the <em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, Decoration Day events of 1872 from different parts of the country were detailed. This information is significant for it shows how the nation healed during the aftermath of the Civil War. Decoration Day, which was later called Memorial Day, was a way for the nation to heal. Both the North and the South found a way to healing the scars of death by honoring and remembering their dead. Over six hundred and twenty thousand soldiers died as a result of the Civil War (Blight, 64). How to remember the slaughter of all the participants became the legacy of the war.","            In May 1868, General John Logan, Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, called on all northern soldiers to decorate the graves of their dead comrades. Twenty-seven states participated in this May 30<sup>th</sup> ritual of placing flowers on the graves and making speeches. The next year, some three hundred and fifty six cities, both in the North and the South, participated in Decoration Day activities (Blight, 71). In the South, Confederate Memorial Day was celebrated on different dates at first. April 26<sup>th</sup>, the date of General Joseph Johnson’s surrender to General William Sherman, was used by many of the southern states (Blight, 77). Some southern states such as North Carolina and South Carolina used May 10<sup>th</sup>, which was the birthday of Stonewall Jackson. Virginia used June 3<sup>rd</sup> in honor of Jefferson Davis’ birthday (Blight, 77 – 78). By 1872, both the North and the South celebrated together with May 30<sup>th</sup> as the official day for Decoration Day as the holiday helped socially heal and bring together everyone. Black veterans marched and placed flowers alongside white veterans of the Civil War (Blight, 78 – 81).

This meeting held special significance because all fifteen nations of the Security Council were represented by their foreign ministers, rather than UN ambassadors. The reason for such a prestigious attendance was Resolution 678 (1990). This resolution gave the United States led coalition the authority to invade Kuwait and repulse the Iraqi army on January 17, 1991. The council president and U.S. Secretary of State James Baker gave a speech at the conclusion of the meeting, reaffirming the council’s choice to approve the resolution and demonstrating the extent to which the U.S. foreign policy had adopted multilateralism.","            In his speech, Baker emphasized the group contribution to this effort, “We have taken political, economic and military measures…we have worked out a coordinated international effort involving over fifty states…” One of the major reasons the U.S. came to rely more heavily on multilateralism during the 1990s was that it was becoming more apparent that force alone was not the most effective method of achieving U.S. goals abroad. Historian Ekaterina Stepanova enumerates other potent instruments of foreign policy that the US would employ, “economic sanctions, international legal mechanisms, political and diplomatic levers.” These tactics, many of which were used on Iraq prior to the start of the Persian Gulf War, are most effective when used in coordination with multiple nations. A further reason for the increased multilateralism was the growing globalization of the economies of the world. The famed Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, recognized this growing trend and how it would affect global politics, “The world is integrating and fragmenting at the same time.” Eban was commenting on how the more entwined the nations of the world became, the more complex and divisive the world and its problems would likewise become. The most likely avenue of success to solve such convoluted issues would be for nations to work in concert with one another.","Baker also acknowledged how the recent geopolitical changes, most significantly the ending of the Cold War, made it possible for this resolution to exist, “the result is a new fact: a newly effective United Nations Security Council, free of the constraints of the cold war.” The Cold War and its mentality dominated the previous four decades. At the conflict’s conclusion, these perceptions began to fall away, allowing for nations to take a fresh look at the world. Historian Richard E. Feinberg related, “Now the industrial countries will be able to perceive developing nations more objectively and better appreciate their uniqueness and social systems.” In this case, the U.S., Russia and other nations of the Security Council were able to see the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, not as another showdown between the forces of communism and the forces of democracy, but simply as a breach of international law, which necessitated a united, international response."],"display_date":"November 29, 1990","search_date":"1990-11-29","locations":[{"id":52854,"lat":40.7496161,"lng":-73.9666718,"zoom":15,"place":"United Nations Headquarters, New York, N"}],"tags":[{"id":2846,"tag":"Persian Gulf War, UN"},{"id":1449883008,"tag":null}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6464,"title":"Protestors Impede Police Arrests at Stonewall Inn","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"6/28/69","end_date":"6/28/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Tensions heightened between the New York City Police Department (NYCPD) and large numbers of gay, transgender, and other sexual minorities during the hot summer of 1969. Raids on gay bars, such as the Stonewall Inn, became frequent, due to laws against serving alcohol to gay people. In the early hours of June 28, the NYCPD conducted a raid on the Stonewall Inn, arresting several cross-dressing people as well as gay men and women.","The New York <em>Daily News</em> published a photograph that illustrates the outburst of anger throughout the crowd, as dozens of gay men in particular refused to stand aside for the police. This image also ties together the growing sense of outrage and willingness to do something about it, as previously the gay community was fighting quietly for their rights.","Savannah Dooley, a journalist for the LBGT magazine <em>The Advocate</em>, records that violence escalated inside the bar, with police beating one lesbian woman over the head with a club for resisting arrest. A gathering crowd outside the bar heard her cries, as well as other sounds of violence, and grew increasingly agitated. They began throwing empty beer bottles and attempted to overturn police wagons, eventually forcing the policemen inside the bar to retreat. Some participants even pried open the front door of the bar with a ripped up parking meter.","The raid on the Stonewall Inn was a touchstone for the gay civil rights movement, as noted by Rick Bragg, a reporter for the <em>New York Times</em>, looking back on the raid and subsequent riots from 1994. The raid began a series of riots that put the gay rights movement into the public eye. The influential activist group the Gay Liberation Front formed directly after the riots, reinforcing the righteous anger expressed during the raid and keeping the gay rights movement in the news. The anger felt by the demonstrators in the photo reverberated through the years after Stonewall, leading to an increased focus on gay rights and, eventually, a greater level of civil liberties for all members of the LBGT community. As Sherry Wolf, author of Sexuality and Socialism, noted: “The riots alone would not be remembered today for transforming gay politics if they had not been followed by organizations that transformed the raw outrage into an ongoing social force.”","The newspaper photo demonstrates that sense of rage reaching its limit, and would eventually be funneled into creating organizations such as the GLF. Other protestors watch in the background, signaling that the night’s events would spiral into a much larger experience, eventually becoming a benchmark in the history of the gay rights movement."],"display_date":"June 28, 1969","search_date":"1969-06-28","locations":[{"id":52861,"lat":40.7335719,"lng":-74.0027418,"zoom":7,"place":"Greenwich Village, New York, NY, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2676,"tag":"Stonewall"},{"id":1596,"tag":"Riots"},{"id":2857,"tag":"LBGT"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6476,"title":"Vietnam Veteran, Ron Kovic, recalls lack of care in V.A. hospital.","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"3/6/68","end_date":"3/6/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a Vietnamese rifle severed his spinal cord, Ron Kovic bounced around Vietnam field hospitals and eventually landed in a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in New York. Kovic found himself being treated in unbearable conditions by nurses and doctors who were often being overworked and unsupported. Kovic laid in his own filth at times while hospital staff could not make it to him to clean up his area or change his bedpan. Not only was the hospital run down and grossly understaffed but the nurses and doctors often had horrible attitudes towards the war and the veterans. Nurses even told Kovic how “nobody gives a crap about the war in Vietnam” while rats run around the filthy floors scavenging food. Meanwhile, the government failed to recognize severe problems in their VA hospitals.","            Throughout the 1960s and 1970s thousands of Vietnam veterans were coming home wounded from the war. Whether they came home with a bullet wound or missing a limb, they often spent time in VA hospitals across the nation. These hospitals often were kept in poor conditions mainly because of the lack of nurses and money that the government was spending on the war. Wounded veteran Kovic recalled that, \"It never makes any sense to us how the government can keep asking for money for weapons and leave us lying in our own filth.” The government prioritized their spending more on the war effort and less on the veterans and their treatment after returning home.","            The conditions in these hospitals and treatment of patients were often made worse because of the nursing shortage that was occurring at the time. As Kara Dixon has noted, army nurses during World War Two often numbered around forty or fifty thousand. During the Vietnam War this number reached an all time low of less than five thousand army nurses. This shortage caused many issues in the dark days of the war in Vietnam when thousands of soldiers arrived home wounded and in need of assistance.","            Since the lack of Army nurses was growing during the Vietnam War this forced the hiring of many civilian nurses and doctors to work in VA hospitals. This often led to a lack of personal care from the nurses and an understaffing of many of the hospitals. It was not uncommon for civilian nurses to oppose the war and they would let veterans know about it often. Kovic remembers vividly the day when a hospital nurse came to him and said “You can take your Vietnam and shove it up your ass.\" A comment like this showed the overall attitude of some of the nurses and the poor conditions that many of these veterans would have to return home to after serving their country."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"March 6, 1968","search_date":"1968-03-06","locations":[{"id":21194,"lat":40.8370495,"lng":-73.8654295,"zoom":8,"place":"Bronx, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":292,"tag":"Vietnam"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":2873,"tag":"Veteran"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6514,"title":"Lincoln Addresses Political Corruption in Philadelphia, PA","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-17","end_date":"1864-08-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Summer of 1864 in Washington and Philadelphia, Abraham Lincoln can be seen doing one of the things that he did best; playing domestic politics.  When it came to political maneuvering and deal making, there were few to rival his adroit handling of the political landscape.  For some, seeing Lincoln as a working politician reduces the lofty pedestal we have placed him on, but political maneuvering was a key component of Lincoln's success in Washington.  Sidney Blumenthal of Newsweek rightly noted, \"But lifting Lincoln above the fray doesn’t remove him from politics. While the political Lincoln may be difficult for us to acknowledge at a time when politics and partisan commitments are widely denigrated, Lincoln’s presidency demonstrates that partisanship and political ruthlessness can be used to advance the highest ideals.\"  In Philadelphia in 1864 that meant keeping Republicans in Congress.  As a case in point, Lincoln's involvement in the events surrounding  the 1865 U.S. House of Representatives election in Pennsylvania’s 4th district provides a perfect example."," ","On June 17th 1864 the New York Tribune printed an article claiming that Postmaster-General Blair had directed the Postmaster of Philadelphia, Cornelius A. Walborn, to instruct his employees not to vote for William D. “Pig Iron” Kelley (R) in the upcoming Congressional election for the 4th district of Pennsylvania.  The next day, Postmaster Walborn denied the allegations in the Tribune and Lincoln sent him a telegram requesting that he come to Washington to see the President.  On June 19th Judge Kelley writes Lincoln and explains that he believes the Tribune article to be correct and that furthermore, he can provide witnesses and would be happy to confront Walborn with Lincoln at the White House.  On June 20th Lincoln met with Postmaster Walborn and discussed the accusation made against him. During this interview, Lincoln clearly states that Walborn is to cease any interference in the upcoming election. "," ","Over one month later, on July 28th, Lincoln sent a telegram to John W. Forney requesting that he and Morten McMichael come to see him in Washington.  While the reason for the meeting can not be ascertained from the telegram itself, further investigation reveals a possible motive. John W. Forney, a Republican, was the current Secretary of the U.S. Senate and former Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Morten McMichael was a successful Philadelphia newspaper editor and publisher, and future Republican mayor of Philadelphia.  By examining future correspondence between Lincoln and these two men, we are able to infer what they may have discussed. "," ","On August 3rd, six days after Lincoln's telegram to Forney, and four/five days after their meeting, Forney writes Lincoln from Philadelphia. In his letter, Forney alerts the president that postal workers in Philadelphia are being pressured into voting for someone they do not like, and it is not Judge Kelley, the Republican candidate. He urges the president to intervene in order to prevent political corruption from dictating the results of the upcoming election.  It can be inferred from that letter that Forney was sent to Philadelphia to investigate whether or not Walborn had ceased his earlier attempts to inappropriately influence voters. In addition to Forney’s letter, and arriving two days prior, Lincoln received a letter from Judge Kelley explaining that Walborn was still agitating against Kelley’s re-election to Congress."," ","Two days later on August 5th, Lincoln sends a message to Morten McMichael in which he asks him to convey the president's concerns to Postmaster Walborn and to remind Walborn that he promised the president that he was not interfering in the upcoming election.  Finally, four days later on August 9th, Lincoln receives from Walborn an assurance that he is faithfully upholding his promise to the president, even including a copy of the notice that has been hung in the Postmaster's office and in post offices under his control which explains that postal workers are free to vote for whomever they see fit.  This message to Lincoln from Walborn appears to settle the issue and we may infer that Lincoln was able to get Walborn back in line. "," ","In the coming election, Kelley is re-elected and he remained in office until 1890."],"display_date":"June 17, 1864 - August 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-13","locations":[{"id":52780,"lat":39.9550145,"lng":-75.1629427,"zoom":7,"place":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"id":52826,"lat":38.898623,"lng":-77.036535,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52909,"lat":40.7155044,"lng":-74.0066837,"zoom":8,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":2969,"tag":"Lincoln Politics 1864"},{"id":2970,"tag":"Phil., PA Politics 1864"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6525,"title":"Abraham Lincoln vs. New York World Newspaper","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-18","end_date":"1864-05-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the course of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was responsible for shutting down more than 300 newspapers (1).

In another telegram sent on May 18th, 1864, it is discovered that a forged document of some kind was printed in the newspaper (2). This document was a fake proclamation by Lincoln to add 400,00 troops to the Northern army (2). The Department of State quickly released a statement claiming the document was false, and Lincoln ordered an immediate shut down of the newspaper (2). It was later discovered that a man named Joseph Howard, a known prankster, was behind the forged document (2)."," ","In the telegrams sent on May 18th, 1864, it is clear that the newspaper printed a forged document that contained both Lincoln and his Secretary of War's signatures (2). An actual forged document could have raised some legal questions in regards to forgery on part of the newspaper, and most would agree that legal action should be taken in the event of forged documents. However, it was not always a forged document that caused Lincoln to shut down newspapers or detain editors without hearings. Newspapers like the New York World often heavily disagreed with Lincoln's policies and the war in general. Lincoln also suspended the writ of habeus corpus, even though Chief Justice Roger Tanney ruled this unconstitutional, citing that only Congress had the power to do so (3). Lincoln’s suppression of the New York World newspaper and other media outlets caused some controversy regarding First Amendment rights during the war, and has even sparked some modern controversy in the eye of public memory.

For instance, in the Roman Empire cloth bandages were used by civilized members of society while “their savage sisters in Africa and Australia used bandages made of grass or vegetable fiber.” In ancient Japan women vaginally inserted layered paper held in place with a bandage.  “The commercial tampon as we know it has been shaped and re-shaped by a myriad of invisible forces—like genuine concern for women’s wellness, certainly, but also sexism, panic, feminism, capitalism, and secrecy.” Up until 1925, American women wore a diaper-like garment made of flannel, which they washed and reused. They were bulky and uncomfortable. In 1896, a sanitary napkin was manufactured by Johnson and Johnson but was withdrawn from the market because advertising this type of personal product was not seen as socially acceptable because of the terse morality of the day. There was a lot of puritanical discomfort with the concept of women touching themselves in any way in their genital area. “People thought that tampon use was inappropriate because it might break the hymen . . . and might be . . . pleasurable and might be a way for girls to experience orgasmic pleasure.”","Historically, tampons had been documented in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They were used for purposes other than menstrual management. In 1776 a French doctor describes tampons which were “tightly rolled, vinegar-soaked linen that was used to stem the flow of hemorrhage and leucorrhea.”  In the late nineteenth century Dr. Paul F. Munde, an accomplished gynecologist, described eight distinct uses for the tampon; number eight was “the absorption of vaginal and uterine discharges.\"","It was in World War I that French nurses discovered that the bandages they used to stop the bleeding of wounded soldiers could be used by menstruating women. The material was more absorbent than the cloth diapers that were used at that time. Slowly, women’s personal products came out of the closet.  Attitudes began to change as women flooded into the work force and became increasingly independent.  Advertisers picked up on this and Tampax went on to become “one of the great game-changers in twentieth century periods.”"],"display_date":"October 15, 1937","search_date":"1937-10-15","locations":[{"id":52909,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":3078,"tag":"tampon"},{"id":3079,"tag":"tampons"},{"id":3080,"tag":"Tampax"},{"id":3081,"tag":"Tampax tampons"},{"id":3082,"tag":"period"},{"id":3083,"tag":"women's periods"},{"id":3084,"tag":"menstruation"},{"id":1849,"tag":"Advertisement"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":162,"school_id":43}},{"id":6613,"title":"Her American Dream: Shirley Chisholm for President","course_id":163,"status":"P","start_date":"12/24/71","end_date":"12/24/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the night of December 24, 1971, New York City mayor John V. Lindsay invited the congresswoman from Brooklyn, Shirley Chisholm, to his mansion. Progressive politicians across the country worried about the split in voters if the three potential candidates continued their campaigns for president. Lindsay took it upon himself to convince Chisholm to drop out of the race in order to not draw the black vote away from himself, or from South Dakota Senator, George McGovern. However, the congresswoman remained intent on her goal to shine a spotlight on the corruption and foot dragging of white, male politicians. She fired back, “If you’re so worried about cutting into the progressive vote, why don’t you and McGovern get together - and one of you decide to back out?” Chisholm saw herself as a representative of the American Dream, a black woman making a run for the most powerful position in the country.","Shirley Chisholm became the first black female congresswoman in 1968. After winning her congressional seat, Chisholm stated, “I will fight until I can’t fight anymore. I don’t mind the challenge.” As a congresswoman, she remained outspoken. Her maiden speech to Congress was against spending in Vietnam, and in it she argued that war funding should be redirected to attack hunger and poverty. Chisholm saw fit to hire a largely female staff in order to provide more opportunities for advancement for women in politics. She also sat as an honorary President of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. Chisholm stood out as a symbol for the black, working class district that voted for her because she never lost touch with her constituency. She argued that the major problem with Congress was that politicians feared sacrificing their political careers in order to stand up for the people they represented. Her independence and reputation as a spitfire left her without many allies in government, so she passed little legislation. However, as historian Julie Gallagher notes, Chisholm chose to fight what she saw as a stagnant system from the inside out.","Chisholm was a symbol of political success for many across the country. She eventually chose to run for president to break the mold. She ran in order to show that an African American woman could make a serious attempt at taking the highest office in the country. The political climate created by social movements of the 1960s and 1970s primed Chisholm’s candidacy, along with her ability to identify with those around her. While she received the endorsement of the Black Panther Party, most black leadership and women’s organizations offered little more than verbal encouragement to her campaign. As a powerful figure to minority groups, multiple interest groups tried to own her and her candidacy in order to bring national attention to their cause. However, Chisholm resisted the ownership of interest groups. She continued in her campaign as an independent exposing the problems with status quo politics. This independence contributed to her defeat by Senator George McGovern for the 1972 Democratic nomination."],"display_date":"December 24, 1971","search_date":"1971-12-24","locations":[{"id":52987,"lat":40.776058,"lng":-73.9430817,"zoom":11,"place":"Gracie Mansion, New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":1561,"tag":"1972 Election"},{"id":1519,"tag":"Shirley Chisholm"},{"id":2021,"tag":"African American history"}],"course":{"name":"History of U.S. Presidential Elections","school":"Wayne State University","course_id":163,"school_id":92}},{"id":6622,"title":"The Evolution of Hospital Beds","course_id":165,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/21","end_date":"12/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The evolution of the hospital bed has changed drastically since it the concept was first thought of in the early nineteen hundreds.  They became important when patients were needing procedures done and had to stay in the hospital for a significant amount of time.  Nurses were a major influence on changes that were made to hospital beds in the beginning of medicine due to the fact that they were the ones who were at the patients bed side providing close care to the patients, thus discovering how a hospital bed could be most useful when providing the highest quality of patient care during this time period (U. 1963).","The Textbook of Surgical Nursing, which was written in 1921, is a good way to understand how hospital beds were first assembled and what the purpose was to provide better patient care.  The first hospital beds used, if they can still be called that with the hospital beds that we in medicine know today, they were essential just tables with no padding, sheets, or pillows (U. 1963).","All of these simple things we know to be standards in hospital care today.  Although this textbook was written for education purposes in the United States, it is recognized in this textbook that other countries around the world use different standards for hospital beds used in medical care (U. 1963).  It is thought that all hospital beds are like the ones found here in the United States of America but as The Textbook of Surgical Nursing points out this is not the case."],"display_date":"1921 - 1963","search_date":"1942-07-02","locations":[{"id":52994,"lat":47.7626174,"lng":-120.1909114,"zoom":7,"place":"Ellensberg, WA"},{"id":52909,"lat":44.1158828,"lng":-78.032887,"zoom":21,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":3167,"tag":"hospital bed"},{"id":3147,"tag":"Bed"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6752,"title":"Dr. Josephine Baker: Baby Savior of Hell's Kitchen","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/02","end_date":"6/1/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Manhattan neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen was truly living up to its name in the summer of 1902. The oppressive heat and ripe stench gripped at Dr. Sara Josephine Baker as she climbed floor after floor of the crowded tenements, knocking on doors in the neighborhood in search of sick babies as part of her job with the New York City Department of Health. Dr. Baker was faced with all measures of poverty and squalor- cockroaches skittering across the floors, dead flies floating in milk bottles, and “dying baby after dying baby.” At the time, as many as 1500 babies died every week during that summer, and it was Dr. Baker’s job to record and report these statistics. According to her memoirs, Dr. Baker recounted that mothers felt helpless against the epidemics of the day: “[The mothers] were just horribly fatalistic about it while it was going on. Babies always died in summer and there was no point in trying to do anything about it.”","Dr. Baker later collected her recommendations for new mothers based on her years of fieldwork and research into her 1920 book, Healthy Babies. This handbook for mothers does not offer cures for diseases, but instead offers suggestions on how to keep a baby well. In the preface of the book, Dr. Baker makes it clear that “methods of keeping babies well are simple and easy,” and emphasizes many times over that any mother with common sense can provide a clean and safe environment for her child. In clear and concise language, Dr. Baker instructs mothers on what temperature to keep the nursery (66 to 68 degrees in the day), and dictates if babies must have toys, they should be washable. Dr. Baker wrote this book based on the assumption that a mother could positively impact her baby’s health rather than leaving it to chance, and also promotes the idea of “wellness” over simply “not being sick.” The existence of such a book reflects the time it was written. Between her sweltering summer in Hell’s Kitchen and the year this book was published, infant health in New York City improved by leaps and bounds, and much of this can be attributed to Dr. Baker herself.","The years of fieldwork amongst the poorest of New York City’s families inspired Dr. Baker as she rose through the ranks of the Department of Health, where she eventually held the position of Commissioner of Health. In 1908, she was appointed director of the newly formed Bureau of Child Hygiene, the first agency of its kind in the United States, and immediately began efforts to coordinate the programs all of the child hygiene agencies in the city. Dr. Baker’s programs exemplified public health at its best, streamlining and connecting existing organizations to work together towards the common goal of preventing child mortality and improving conditions of child hygiene across the board. Under her guidance, every reported new mother was visited by a public health nurse, who instructed the mother on proper care and feeding practices and gave her informational pamphlets. Milk stations, which provided the city’s mothers with quality milk for their babies at low prices or for free, partnered with Dr. Baker’s bureau and developed into child health stations. These stations not only offered nutritious food for children, but offered education on child care, and later provided vaccinations. By the time Dr. Baker retired in 1923, New York City had the lowest infant mortality rate in the country. Dr. Sara Josephine Baker’s impact on infant health in New York City, and public health as a whole, cannot be overstated."],"display_date":"June 1, 1902 - June 1, 1920","search_date":"1911-06-01","locations":[{"id":53100,"lat":40.7830603,"lng":-73.9712488,"zoom":13,"place":"Manhattan, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3450,"tag":"josephine baker"},{"id":3449,"tag":"infant health"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}},{"id":6759,"title":"Emily Blackwell becomes the third woman to earn a medical degree in the United States!","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1893-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Inspired by her older sister, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (the first woman to earn a medical degree in the United States), Dr. Emily Blackwell studied medicine. Like her sister, she did not have an easy journey. Dr. Blackwell’s sister warned her from the beginning, “a blank wall of social and professional antagonism faces the woman physician that forms a situation of painful loneliness, leaving her without support, respect or professional counsel.” She was rejected from eleven medical schools, due to complaints from male students, but continued to carry on.","            Medicine at this time, in 1854, was going through a transition. The onset of industrialization brought about important alterations in the organization of work and family life, which created a change to the role of women, and made more middle-class women comfortable with studying medicine. Before this time, there was a specific role for women that limited them, they were to stay at home and care for the house and children. The advances in medical science have begun to call traditional therapeutics into question, and older concepts of professionalism are being challenged. Women brought another element to medicine, humanity.","            Emily saved money for her education through her salary as a teacher, and persisted on for the cause of women in medicine, and for this she was willing to struggle. Prior, Dr. Emily Blackwell was studying, and teaching, music. “I soon felt the want of a more engrossing pursuit than the study of music, German, and metaphysics. The suggestion of studying medicine was first presented to me by a lady friend who was ill and said to me, “if I could be treated by a lady doctor, my worst suffering would have been spared me.” Dr. Blackwell went on to write to physicians she knew through her family, and in various parts in the country, about the possibilities of a woman becoming a physician. Most of her responses concluded with, “the idea is a great one, but also impossible.” Using this as inspiration, she started her journey. After spending a year at Rush Medical College her studies ended, the college bowed to pressure from the state medical society and rescinded her admission. 1852, she spent the summer in New York, gaining practical experience at her sister’s side among poor immigrant women. She went on to attend Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where she became the second woman to earn a medical degree after graduating in 1854. At the time of her graduation there were 1,206 students, with her being the only woman.","In 1857 the Blackwell sisters and established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. By 1874 the infirmary served over 7,000 patients annually. In 1868, the Blackwell sisters established the Women's Medical College in New York City. Emily became professor of obstetrics and, in 1869, became dean of the college. In 1876 it became a three-year institution, and in 1893 it became a four-year college, ahead of much of the profession. By 1899 the college had trained 364 women doctors. Dr. Emily Blackwell’s determination to not give up on pursuing a profession in medicine inspired many women to follow in her footsteps. She played a large part in helping other women in the same journey.

Typically docile, well-mannered, and pious, she shouted obscenities, overcome with rage displayed in forceful expressions of perversions. Dr. Alphonso Rockwell could do little to comfort the woman and spent most of the night there. The evening was interrupted when William Miller, a kind-hearted and elderly “electrician,” arrived at the door with a single, ordinary induction coil. Amusedly, Rockwell watched the uneducated man administer a dose of electricity, hereby witnessing unforeseen positive results. ","In <em>Rambling recollections: an autobiography</em>, Rockwell detailed his experience treating a woman with brain inflammation and impotence in remedying the increasingly common condition. Historical and sociological research published in<em> Pushbutton Psychiatry</em> explained its growing presence as the consequence of evolving American culture. In the years following the Civil War, new liberties complicated life and affected the psyche. Nerve sensitivities were exhausted by new demands of politics, religion, education, and philosophical thought. Women were deemed particularly susceptible, ill-equipped to handle such great mental activity. In 1868, medicine provided no relief for these mental afflictions, but Rockwell’s patient provided him undeniable proof of the need for alternative treatment.","Research into Miller’s method proved risky. Electrotherapeutics were mentioned only in hushed voices, considered little more than quackery. The stigma stemmed from its cultivation by ignorant laymen, based solely on experience rather than pathology or electrophysiology. Its early application was crude, a current forced into the body using a battery or induction coil and wire—without knowledge of various electric currents or their effects on diseases. The media further influenced the stigma with advertisements for illegitimate at-home devices, rendering physicians powerless to distinguish electrotherapeutics as medical science. Entering this field could quickly tarnish a doctor’s reputation. ","However, the meeting with Miller gripped him. Despite professional hazards, Rockwell retired his general practitioner title and began an apprenticeship under him. He began his own practice and recorded thousands of cases with his silent partner, Dr. George Beard. He experimented on charity cases directed from Beard’s clinic to develop theories and standard applications. After only two years, they accumulated enough research to publish several articles, which piqued substantial curiosity in the medical community. In 1871, they published <em>A practical treatise on the medical and surgical uses of electricity, including localized and general electrization</em>. This lengthy piece explained what lay-practitioners could not: electrization was a stimulating tonic that immediately disrupted ailments and, after long-term exposure, improved disposition and strengthened the brain and muscles’ capacity for labor. This revelation was invaluable in remedying the overly-taxed population. "," ","Rockwell could not have known his visit to a hysterical patient would be a catalyst for the scientific acceptance of a quack treatment. He provided strong evidence that electrotherapeutics could increase the ability to tackle the demands of modernizing civilization. Its merit was validated by prestigious individuals seeking its benefits and widespread introduction of electrotherapeutic devices in institutions. Though methodology hardly resembles its beginning, the practice continues to be used in the modern day, despite the persistent stigma and controversy that accompany it. "],"display_date":"1868 - 1871","search_date":"1869-12-31","locations":[{"id":53110,"lat":40.8115504,"lng":-73.9464769,"zoom":8,"place":"Harlem"},{"id":8915,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3472,"tag":"alternative medicine"},{"id":3489,"tag":"Electrotherapeutics"},{"id":3490,"tag":"Electricity"},{"id":3491,"tag":"Shock therapy"},{"id":3492,"tag":"Quack medicine"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}},{"id":6767,"title":"Icones Anatomicae: Reviving a Passion in Science and Medicine 400 Years in the Making","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/34","end_date":"12/31/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the year 1543, Andreus Vesalius published the <em>De Humani Corporis Fabricae</em> and revolutionized the medical landscape. The work was a masterpiece. It combined the fields of art and anatomy and cut to the core of human anatomical understanding. In order to most accurately depict the anatomy of the human body, Vesalius employed several artists and had them attend anatomical dissections and demonstrations. Their beautiful drawings were then transferred to woodblocks for printing, and here is where our story begins. The original woodblocks were lost for nearly 400 years until in 1932 Dr. Samuel Lambert, President of the New York Academy of Medicine, heard a colleague make mention of an anatomy professor at Basel who wrote of the survival of several original blocks at the University of Munich Library. An ecstatic Dr. Lambert then set into motion a series of events that would culminate in the 1934 publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae</em>.","<em>Icones Anatomicae</em> is a masterpiece in itself. It is an anthology consisting of the <em>De Humani Corporis Fabricae, </em>the<em> Tabulae Anatomicae Sex, </em>several personal letters, and a few of Vesalius’ previously unpublished works.  The publication was received with much acclaim. The influence of Andreus Vesalius and his impact on the field of medicine were already well understood in the early twentieth century, but not many knew why. Several physicians, historians, and artists decided that along with the publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae,</em> an explanation of the significance of Vesalius and his work was necessary. J.B. Saunders and Charles O’Malley held nothing back in their praise of Vesalius in their 1950 book, <em>The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels.</em> They explain that his work signaled “the beginning of modern observational science and research,” essentially calling Vesalius the father of not just anatomy, but of <em>all of modern science</em>. Saunders and O’Malley go on to compare Vesalius to the likes of Hippocrates, Galen, Harvey, and Lister. Then, in 1952, John F. Fulton published <em>Three Vesalian Essays to accompany the Icones Anatomicae of 1934</em>, hoping to further illustrate why Vesalius was so important and why the publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae</em> was such a momentous occasion. Samuel Lambert commissioned the essays in 1932 hoping to give modern context to the significance of <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>and the impact of Vesalius’ work. ","Before Vesalius, science, and specifically anatomy and medicine, lectures were taught from purely textual classic sources, such as Galen. Vesalius was the first to emphasize the importance of visual aids in scientific texts. Vesalius’ contributions to the fields of anatomy, medicine, and art have undeniable influence. Vesalius is just as notable, important, and influential as other renaissance figures. <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>and the essays, books, and articles published to accompany it attempt to outline just how much of an impact Vesalius had on modern science and medicine. Vesalius was able to revive a collective passion in medicine after a millennia and a half of stagnation.

The film dramatized the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The movie took place in Kansas City, Missouri and included cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. <em>The Day After</em> explored the effects of nuclear war from the perspective of ordinary Americans. The story focuses on several sets of characters: most notably Russell Oakes (played by Jason Robards), a doctor and professor at the University of Kansas, the Dahlbergs, a farming family from Harrisonville, Missouri and Billy McCoy (played by William Allen Young), an Air Force reservist stationed at Whiteman Air Base. The film became infamous at the time for scenes of violence and the graphic portrayal of characters perishing from radiation sickness. The movie ends with the ominous warning that “the catastrophic events you have just witnessed, are in all likelihood less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States…” <em>The Day After</em> attracted 100 million viewers, and remains the highest rated television movie in U.S. history.","The controversy surrounding the movie’s release caused an uproar among the American population. Americans criticized U.S. nuclear policy because of what they had seen in the film. ABC and the White House received hundreds of calls from anxious viewers, many of whom supported the movie’s message. Anti-nuclear activists rallied behind movements such as “Let Lawrence Live” and 800-NUCLEAR. Those in favor of nuclear deterrence, however, worried that the emotional fall-out of the movie and controversy surrounding it would negate any critical analysis of nuclear weapons. Director Nicholas Meyer stood firmly on the side of the anti-nuclear activists, denouncing ABC’s attempts to tone down the movie’s political nature. According to historian Deron Overpeck, Meyer wanted to “clobber sixty-million people over the head” with his criticisms of nuclear weapons.","The role <em>The Day After</em> played in changing U.S. nuclear policy is debatable. When the movie premiered in 1983, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were at their worst levels in twenty years. President Ronald Reagan viewed it days before its premier on ABC. While the movie left Reagan shaken and disheartened, he continued to defend nuclear deterrence as a means to pressure the Soviet Union to the negotiating table. Despite this, <em>The Day After</em> spurred public conversation about nuclear war to reach levels unseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis twenty-one years earlier.

Broady in New York City's General Sessions Court. Broady was a private investigator and attorney who pleaded guilty to “three charges of eleven-count of indictment charged with conspiracy and making false representations in order to obtain information from telephone companies”. Judge Mitchell D. Schweitzer sentenced Broady to a six-month suspended sentence on Feb 25th. Regarding what a suspended sentence entailed, it meant that the judge decided to delay the defendant’s prison sentence after he was been found guilty. The judge granted Broady a period of probation, rather than immediately having the defendant serve his sentence. As long as Broady does not break the law again and fulfills the conditions in his probation, his prison sentence would be lifted. Judge Schweitzer noted that the defendant was already serving a “two-four year term for illegal wiretapping - a term that he began serving [in January], so he considered the idea of giving Broady another sentence to serve no purpose”. The sentence that the judge is referring to occurred back in 1955, when Broady was convicted for his involvement in a secret wiretapping business in an apartment located on 360 E. 55th Street, New York City. This organization was linked to 100,000 of the city's telephones. Broady’s collaborators were Shannon B. Warren, an electrical technician; and Walter Asmann and Carl R. Ruh, two members of the New York telephone company. These men placed taps on multiple “business and private phones, and sold the information” to clients. All of the men who involved were detained during a police raid in 1955.  ","As a consequence of this operation’s discovery, it exposed to NYC authorities how easy it was for third parties to illicitly tap into the city’s extensive telephone network. During the 1950s, the crime of eavesdropping in the state of New York existed in a gray area. While the American federal government considered illegal wiretapping as an uncondonable crime, the New York state’s government was far more lenient towards the practice, as its own independent legistation allowed the practice to operate with and without court approval. This meant that there were significant disparities between the federal and state wiretapping statutes. With this knowledge in mind, Broady argued in his 1956 trial that “all state efforts to penalize wiretapping and conduct associated with wiretapping were unconstitutional”. With this argument, Broady attempted to try to avoid being punished for his criminal activity via a legal loophole. This pressured the legal authorities to bring the eavesdroppers to trial as soon as possible, as they were aware of this issue in New York’s wiretapping laws. The original court case in the 50's resulted with Broady being convicted as the operation's brainchild. As for his accomplices, they were acquitted of any charges because they agreed to testify against him. Due to the outcome of this case, the federal government decided to update New York's legal code on wiretapping. By 1957, the state of New York made the practice of unwarranted wiretapping to be officially illegal. Any illegally intercepted evidence was outlawed from being submitted in New York courts. The state’s legal definition of eavesdropping was updated to include bugging on microphones and dictaphones.  "],"display_date":"January 14, 1945 - February 26,

In 1986, DC Comics announced Dennis O’Neil as the writer for the revitalization of the investigative reporter and vigilante hero, The Question.  Originally created by Steve Ditko for Charlton Comics in 1967, The Question, aka Vic Sage, represented a move away from the wholesome, all-powerful superhero and toward a grittier, more human hero.  O’Neil described The Question as an emblem of “human perfectibility,” as much more realistic and flawed than the superheroes of the late 1950s and 1960s.  The Question was to be a vigilante antihero, combatting growing crime and corruption in the nation’s inner cities.  Because of “direct-market distribution” (Wright 277), the comic book industry no longer had to follow the Comics Code Authority in order to sell their characters, so <em>The Question</em> and other comics were able to show the darker and more violent side of American cities.  Distrust in government following the Vietnam War and the perception of rapidly growing crime in inner cities in 1980s America informed the updating of DC’s antihero detective The Question.","            The dishonesty and ineffectiveness of the local government in the revamped <em>The Question</em> comic books reflected the views about government in America following the Vietnam War.  Richard Young asserts that “the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal encouraged enormous public distrust in official state institutions” (566) and that comics in the 1980s “often endorsed an uncompromising anti?establishment ideology that opposed all government, big or small” (563).  People felt as though the war was orchestrated by selfish and inept politicians who cared more about reinforcing an outdated ideology than about the actual citizens.  Vic Sage operated in Hub City, which O’Neil describes as a “cesspool” of crime and corruption.  The mayor, Wesley Fermin, was an inept leader being influenced by Reverend Doctor Jeremiah Hatch, who used the city’s resources for his own personal benefit.  Fermin and Hatch represented government officials who failed in their duty to serve the people, lying to and stealing from city dwellers whenever it was deemed necessary.  The Question’s resistance to this narrative of government corruption gave comic book readers the ability to express their anger and frustration toward their leaders.  DC’s newly revived character reflected the public’s lack of trust in government, not only to use power honestly, but also to protect them from violent crime in the inner cities.","            The growing fear of crime in urban areas during the 1980s led to the introduction of vigilante antiheroes in comic books, which include <em>The Question</em>.  Decades of white flight to the suburbs and the moving of American industry overseas left many poor people of color out of work.  Unable to find well paying jobs, some people turned to crime in order to make money.  The distribution of crack cocaine contributed to a massive growth in the crime rate and overwhelmed law enforcement agencies.  White Americans lived in terror that criminals from the city would travel to their quiet streets and so began a crusade against inner city lawlessness.  Tyler Scully and Kenneth Moorman argue that “A new fear gripped the nation, one that was quite foreign to generations past: a fear of crime, particularly violent, street crime” (635).  Already unhappy with the government after years of fruitless war, the public turned to vigilantes to make themselves feel safer.  The comic book industry created characters such as The Question in response to the popularity of real-life vigilante heroes.  Inspired by urban detectives from the early 1900s, Vic Sage did for the people of Hub City what Fermin and Hatch could not.  He operated outside of the law and worked to clean up the crime-ridden streets of Hub City.  Dennis O’Neil’s reimagining of <em>The Question </em>demonstrated the public’s anxiety about inner city crime and support for vigilante antiheroes.","            The revitalization of <em>The Question</em> by Dennis O’Neil in 1986 reflected the anti-government feelings of the public during the decade.  The failure of the Vietnam War and the rapidly growing fear of inner cities caused many people lose trust in their leaders.  Vigilantes, both real and imagined, captured the attention of many Americans.  DC’s revival of <em>The Question</em> and development of Hub City addressed the concerns of comic book readers during the 1980s."],"display_date":"December 1, 1986 - December 31,

the excitement of a new baseball season approaching during the spring of 1871, several changes to the league became newsworthy. In an article of the <em>New York Times</em> titled, “The Baseball Occurrences of March,” an interesting conversation took place on the advancement of the sport.  For the first time, a convention of delegates from each of the professional clubs in the country convened on March 17, 1871 in New York, to “make arrangements in which the disputes over the selection of umpires may be avoided.” Post-Civil War baseball, still in its infancy, took the country by surprise with its soaring popularity. In dire need of regulations and professional officiation, the ball teams came together to remedy problems with the officiation for what would become America’s pastime within a generation.","The league grew to a point where official rules and regulations became a necessity as high monetary stakes and betting become popular throughout the healing Union.  Benjamin Rader, the author of <em>Baseball: A history of America’s Game</em> stated, “American baseball players tended to exploit every area within the game for which there was no explicit rule or penalties levied for violations.” Frequently there were problems with the officiating of games. In the early days of baseball, teams chose the umpire for contest, but with “a growing premium placed on winning” this unofficial process became a frequently disputed topic due to biased calls. For instance, in 1882, Richard Higham a National League umpire was, “expelled from the game after the league judged him guilty of collusion with gamblers” according to MLB official reports. In another case, one pitcher threw fifty balls to a hitter to discourage him from hitting. Obviously, a hindrance to the game, the league implemented umpires to call strikes on hitters who refused to swing at “good balls” as well as distinguish the difference between a ball and a strike.  These rules, authorized in 1858 by the National Association of Baseball (NABBP), changed the game, but also gave the power to the umpire to rule a previously relaxed officiation of the game. By 1879, according to MLB official information, umpires were “given the authority to impose fines for illegal acts.”","At the beginning, baseball captured the attention of folks from the northeast all the way to the far west. Teams sprouted up in cities and evolved into a commercial league. The incentive to field the “top nine” created a game of competition. With the addition of betting, beer, and eventually hotdogs and popcorn, high stakes baseball needed proper officiation. By the turn of the century, no longer were teams choosing umpires for the contests, rather, it became the league’s responsibility. The official umpiring association today is called the World Umpiring Association and is the bargaining agent for Major League Umpires."," "],"display_date":"March 1, 1871","search_date":"1871-03-01","locations":[{"id":52825,"lat":40.752999449846,"lng":-73.777068841493,"zoom":9,"place":"New York City, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":235,"tag":"Sports"},{"id":1902,"tag":"recreation"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6884,"title":"The Legend and Lesbian Visibility Movement created by Dyke TV","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/93","end_date":"1/31/03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Now is the perfect time to join Dyke TV’s membership roster and join hundreds of lesbians around the country who are making Dyke TV happen”.2 The original Dyke TV subscription letter from 1994 was sent out by the station’s creators: Ana Maria Simo, Linda Chapman and Mary Patierno. These three women fought against the mass media in order to portray real-life lesbians on television, instead of the stereotyped version of lumberjack women who lusted after white married women. Through Dyke TV, they were able to do segments on various aspects of lesbian life, such as: Lesbian Health, Workplace, Street Squad’s “Dyke on the Street”, and I Was a Lesbian Child, where adult women would narrate their childhood photos to the audience. As these segments made their way into the homes of thousands of Americans across the country, they played a massive role in opening the virgin eyes of some to the idea that it was acceptable to be a lesbian. Dyke TV reminded some that they had the right to not only be tolerated, but to be accepted, respected and loved, no matter their sexuality.  ","Dyke TV played an integral part in the lesbian visibility movement. “The political moment of identity politics is over. Now it is time for people to come together”.1 The main purpose of creating Dyke TV was not to create an institution, but a single political movement that lesbians and other individuals could get behind who had been previously left out of alternative movements. Though the lesbians remained in their positions fighting for the rights of others, they also demanded their own political liberation, sexual liberation and liberation in all forms for themselves.  ","While Dyke TV ended airing its shows in 2003, it had lived up to its goal and motto, “to incite, provoke and organize”.2 Dyke TV assisted in the organization and operation of multiple protest marches about the lack of lesbian rights in America. They marched in New York City, Washington D.C., London, Germany, San Francisco, and Seattle. Because of Dyke TV, many lesbians who felt that they did not belong to or in a movement finally had a voice that was heard by the public and gained support by other movements, eventually leading the way to the creation of the LGBTQ+ political movement and group that lives today.  "],"display_date":"June 1993 - January 1903","search_date":"1948-04-01","locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"}],"tags":[{"id":3287,"tag":"Lesbian"},{"id":3691,"tag":"Dyke TV"},{"id":3692,"tag":"LGBTQ+"},{"id":3693,"tag":"Lesbian Visibility"},{"id":3694,"tag":"Lesbian Movement"},{"id":3695,"tag":"New York Marches"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}},{"id":6888,"title":"A Shell Shocked Woman","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/17","end_date":"12/31/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 3rd, 1917, Mrs. De Saulles, a wife and mother in New York City, murdered her husband, shooting him dead after he threatened to take their son away. In a surprising turn of events, however, Mrs. De Saulle’s defense team claimed that she suffered from shell shock, a psychological condition associated with soldiers who had experienced bombing in the Great War. The <em>New York Times</em> reported, “(Her defense team)...will argue that the announcement that she was not to have her son anymore was the equivalent of explosion of a shell in her presence and that she suffered from the same lapse of memory which has been produced frequently in soldiers.” The <em>New York Times</em> asked the doctor who diagnosed her if he considered Mrs. De Saulles to be mentally sane, to which he replied, “I do not.” He argued that the diagnosis of shell shock rendered her insane and not responsible for her actions. These words had a concrete impact on the court: the jury declared her innocent. She later went on to gain custody of her son and live a complete life as a mother.","Shell shock was a new disorder that emerged during World War I, a confusing mental disease that left both soldiers and doctors in a state of turmoil. No one knew the causes or the boundaries of this powerful and harmful illness. Symptoms included tremors, loss of sight and hearing, and memory loss. Social stigmas surrounded shell shock, including ideas of cowardice, femininity, and hysteria. Doctors often accused men of faking their symptoms, not understanding how serious or critical this mental illness was.  For the first year of the war, medical and miliatary authorities did not take shell shock seriously.","Mrs. De Saulles’s case shows the gradual, widespread acceptance of this disease. Claiming shell shock, a mental disease that many believed did not exist, cleared her of her husband’s murder. It took several years for this mental disease to gain recognition and to be taken seriously. In the earlier stages of the war, authorities criticized soldiers for claiming shell shock, but now even a non-soldier asserted this disease with success. Not just any individual, but a woman. Her claim of shell shock was successful: she won her court case, as the jury believed in shell shock as a genuine mental condition. This court case of Mrs. De Saulles, accused of murder, showed powerful strides in acceptance of mental health and the gradual defeat of the stigma surrounding shell shock."],"display_date":"August 1, 1917 - December 31, 1917","search_date":"1917-10-16","locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.702799328925,"lng":-73.90271488317,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":3700,"tag":"Shell Shock"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}},{"id":6892,"title":"Ethel Rosenberg: A Story","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"8/11/50","end_date":"6/19/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“I decline to answer on the grounds that this might tend to incriminate me,”[1] would be repeated nearly twenty-three times by Ethel Rosenberg on that uncomfortable, eighty-eight-degree day in the Southern District Federal Court in New York on August 11, 1950. She was put on the stand by the prosecution because she and her husband, Julius, were charged with espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union. The trial lasted a month. The Rosenbergs refused an offer of life imprisonment if they pled guilty. As a result, they were executed by electric chair in 1953. It was during the height of McCarthyism that the guilt of Ethel and her husband would come into question as they had been widely believed to have been framed.[2] It is understandable that the guilt of a couple like the Rosenburgs, an all-American family with two children and acted like a regular American family by all accounts, would have been called into question during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s because no one in America would want to think that during a time of intense fear and paranoia like the Cold War that an all-around all American couple would go against the nation they were citizens of in order to support the Soviet Union and follow the beliefs of the, at the time, communist Russia because all that did was make everyone extra paranoid about secret communists being everywhere secretly watching what the American people.","According to the FBI’s Vault on Ethel Rosenburg, during the trial, her attorney would ask the jurors in his opening statement, “to not condemn her merely because David Greenglass was a confessed conspirator. He stated that she had protested her innocence from the beginning and that she was dragged into the case by the machinations of the Greenglasses, who wished to lighten their burdens.”[3] Mr. Greenglass, in his testimony against Ethel and Julius, would state, “Ethel told Ruth [wife of David Greenglass] that David was working on the atom bomb project at Los Alamos, and they wanted him to give information concerning the bomb. Ruth told the Rosenbergs that she didn’t think it was a good idea and declined to convey their requests to David. Ethel and Julius then told Ruth that she should at least tell David about it and see if he would help. Julius pointed out that Russia was an ally and deserved the information, and that Russia was not getting all the information that was due her.”[3] Whether or not Ethel Rosenburg was actively participating in acts of espionage for the Soviet Union concerning the atom bomb is difficult to prove as she was not at all cooperative with the FBI during the investigation or the courts during trial."],"display_date":"August 11, 1950 - June 19, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-14","locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":2,"place":"New York City"},{"id":53217,"lat":35.8800364,"lng":-106.3031138,"zoom":2,"place":"Los Alamos New Mexico"}],"tags":[{"id":3705,"tag":"The Cold War"},{"id":3704,"tag":"Ethel Rosenberg"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":3703,"tag":"Cold War America"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}}]}
